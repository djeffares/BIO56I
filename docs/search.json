Orthologous genes often retain the same function in the course of evolution.\nParalogs are like orthologs, in that they have evolved from a common ancestral gene, but they are in the same species and have arisen by gene duplication.\nOrthologous groups are groups of genes from different species that are all orthologous to each other. An orthologous group may contain one gene from each species, or it may contain multiple genes from some species (paralogs).\n\n\nWe can compare the cladogram of the Trypanosomatid species to Figure 2 (below), which is a phylogenetic tree drawn using the single nucleotide differences in ~1000 single copy genes (genes that every species has exactly one of). This phylogenetic tree will be very reliable, as it is created from tens of thousands of single nucleotide differences.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Leishmania are single-celled protozoan parasites that infect mammals, including people. They have two copies of each chromosome (diploid) and reproduce sexually (they undergo meiosis).\nWe’ll focus on Leishmania guyanensis and closely related species found in South America. Together they form a species complex called Viannia—closely related species that can sometimes interbreed where their ranges overlap.\nThese parasites cause cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a skin disease that leads to long-lasting sores. CL is zoonotic, meaning it mostly circulates in wild animals; humans are infected but probably play a small role in maintaining the parasite population.\nBecause Viannia parasites infect many native mammals in South America, they are probably deeply embedded in the region’s ecology.\n\n2.2.1 Leishmania are spread by sand flies\nThree facts about sand flies are important for today:\n\nSand flies are mainly found in forests or forest edges (not in sand on the beach).\nThey are not strong flyers, so they don’t carry Leishmania parasites very long distances.\nThe different sand fly species, and even populations within species, have their own ecological niches and characteristics.\n\nFor example, certain populations of sand flies carry some species of Leishmania, but not others."

Because the Amazon is so biodiverse, several Viannia species may be present there.\nParasites were isolated from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and grown in the lab to extract DNA. We then sequenced the DNA from 70+ parasites using short-read (Illumina) sequencing.\nFrom these genomes, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—tiny differences at single DNA letters. To add context, we also included public data for related Viannia species from the European Nucleotide Archive. A short summary of the computational steps is at the end of this document.\nFor this workshop, all you need to know is that we have SNP data from:\n\n71 Leishmania strains collected in Manaus (most likely to be L. guyanensis)\n21 L. braziliensis strains from various locations in Brazil\n25 L. panamensis strains from Panama\n34 L. peruviana strains from Peru\none L. shawi strain from Brazil\n\nWe’ll use these data to explore species, populations, and mixing (hybridization) within the Viannia group."

    "text": "3.1 Exploring the data\nIn this workshop we will explore the results we generated. We will look at three ways to visualise population structure.\n\n3.1.1 Population genomic data files\nWhile genomes contain many types of polymorphisms, population genomic analysis often uses only single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. This is because SNPs are very abundant and have properties that make them easier to model mathematically.\nSNPs and other polymorphisms are affected by many processes, such as genetic drift, migration, selection and recombination. However, SNP data can be represented relatively simply as a table.\nThe standard format for representing SNP data is called VCF (Variant Call Format). Here is a small example of what a VCF file looks like.\n#CHROM  POS REF ALT Lg1 Lg2 Lg3 Lg4\n01  2177    A   G   0/1 1/1 1/1 0/1\n01  2636    G   A   0/0 0/1 0/1 0/0\n01  9844    G   A   0/1 0/0 0/0 0/0\n...\n35  9999    G   A   1/1 0/0 0/1 0/0\nIt is almost like a table that we could load into Excel, where each row indicates a position in the genome, and columns contain information about that position.\nIt has a header line:\n#CHROM POS REF ALT\nThis indicates that the first column is the chromosome number (#CHROM), the second column is the position on that chromosome (POS), the third column is the reference allele (REF), and the fourth column is the alternative allele (ALT).\nAfter this, we have the genotypes for each sample. In this example, there are four samples:\nLg1 Lg2 Lg3 Lg4\nAfter this, we have the genotypes for the strains that are in the VCF (four in this case). They are coded as 0 for the reference allele (A) and 1 for the alternative allele (G). So for an A/G polymorphism:\n\nAA is coded as 0/0\nAG is coded as 0/1\nGG is coded as 1/1\n\nThe population genomics community has developed many software tools that process these data to extract information (no tool does it all). In this workshop we will look at a phylogenetic tree, principal components analysis (PCA), and a STRUCTURE plot. These are all used to describe population structure and detect hybrids between populations or between species."

    "section": "3.2 The phylogeny",
    "text": "3.2 The phylogeny\nA phylogenetic tree is a good first look at how similar or different many samples are. But when individuals mix between populations or species (hybridisation), a simple branching tree can be misleading.\nThink of a tree of people grouped by ancestry. Where would you place someone with one parent from Spain and one from Fiji? They don’t fit neatly on a single branch with the Spanish and the Fijians. The same display issue can happen in nature when populations interbreed.\nTo handle this, we used a network approach (a splits network made with the software SplitsTree) that can show conflicting signals in the data—like those caused by mixing between populations or species.\nBelow is our SplitsTree network. There are many samples, so coloured dots cluster tightly. The Manaus samples are dark blue. Most cluster near Leishmania guyanensis at the top. We marked the Manaus samples that do not with arrows.\n Figure 2: A SplitsTree phylogeny. The overall phylogeny is in the centre, and we zoom in to various clades (groups of related samples) around the edges. Each dot is a sample, coloured by species. The dark blue dots are samples we collected from Manaus, Brazil.\n\n3.2.1 Interpreting the phylogeny\nNow spend some time discussing the SplitsTree phylogeny, using the discussion points below as a guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: phylogeny\n\n\n\n\nFrom this figure, do the Viannia species look clearly separated, or do some overlap?\nAnswer: Yes, the species are mostly separated, but there looks to be a hybrid in the inset on the right.\nA few Manaus samples don’t cluster with L. guyanensis. What could explain that?\nAnswer: Some of the Manaus samples are different species. So there must be several species in this location.\n\n\nWhat might this suggest about the causes of CL in the Amazon (e.g., multiple species, local ecology, host/vector differences)?\n\n\nAnswer: There are multiple species. They might interbreed in this location, but we cannot see this in the current phylogeny. We cannot tell anything about local ecology, host/vector differences from this phylogeny.\n\n\nLook at the L. peruviana–L. braziliensis area (red box). One strain sits between the two. What could that indicate?\n\n\nAnswer: This is probably a hybrid.\n\n\nExamine the data from the single L. shawi sample (light blue). Does its branch look unusually short? Remember: branch lengths indicate the genetic distance between strains or species.\n\n\nAnswer: Yes, it does look short. This is suspicious, but it is difficult to diagnose from this representation of the data. This shows a limitation of phylogeny."

    "section": "3.3 Principal components clustering",
    "text": "3.3 Principal components clustering\nPopulation structure is an important facet of most (if not all) species. Populations sometimes split into species, and all natural selection begins within a population. So when we start to examine the genetic diversity of a species, it is wise to look at population structure.\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) is a useful tool for understanding population structure. PCA reduces the variables in our data set (thousands of SNPs in rows, and many individuals in columns), while preserving a lot of the information about population structure.\nA simple way to interpret PCA data is to consider that the distance between two individuals on a two-dimensional PCA plot represents the genetic distance between those samples. So, if they are close on the plot, they are close genetically. If they are distant on the plot, they are distant genetically. We would expect individuals from within a population or species to fall close to each other on a PCA plot.\nFirst look at Figure 3 below. This shows PCA clustering of all the other Viannia species, apart from the samples we collected from Manaus. Discuss with the people at your table:\n\nDo the species cluster genetically?\nDo L. peruviana and L. braziliensis really look like two different species?\n\nNote: The blue dashed lines are a guide to the eye to help you see the clusters.\n Figure 3. PCA clustering of Viannia species from throughout South America.\nNow look at Figure 4, which shows PCA clustering of Viannia species from throughout South America (on the left), and those that were collected from Manaus (on the right). Note that the PC axes are on the same scale here.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. PCA clustering of all the Leishmania samples from throughout South America (left), and those that were collected from Manaus (right)\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Interpreting principal component plots\nUse the discussion points below to discuss the PCA plots with the people at your table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA (species)\n\n\n\n\nDoes it look like the samples that came from Manaus are all the same species?\nAnswer: No certainly not. Some are in the same position as L. guyanensis, but others are from different species.\nSince the positions on the PCA plot separate the species, does this help to identify the species from Manaus?\nAnswer: Yes, some are L. guyanensis, some are L. naiffi and others L. peruviana.\nWhat does this tell you about the causes of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Amazon region?\nAnswer: Since all these samples were collected from cutaneous leishmaniasis patients, this disease is caused by at least three different Leishmania species.\nSince Leishmania are single-celled organisms and they all cause a similar disease, population genomics is the only way to identify which sample belongs to which species. Why would we not merely use PCR to identify the species?\nAnswer: Because we do see hybrids. If we used PCR, we might misidentify hybrids as one species or the other, depending on which gene we amplified. Population genomics allows us to see the whole genome, so we can identify hybrids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Principal components clustering 2: geography and genetics\nWe can look at the PC plots another way, simply by colouring the samples according to where they came from (geography).\nBecause sand flies that carry Leishmania do not fly very far, it is possible that geographic distance is the main factor that determines the genetic distance between Leishmania populations. This concept is called isolation by distance.\nThe Leishmania parasites we have genome data for come from Brazil, Peru and Panama, which are very far apart, so we might expect to see isolation by distance in the PCA plot.\nNote that in Figure 5 below: - the colour of each point indicates the location where the sample was collected - the position on the PCA plot indicates how closely related each sample is. If two strains sit close together on the plot, they are closely related genetically.\n\n\nFigure 5. PCA clustering of Viannia species from throughout South America. The blue dashed lines are not important here, but will help with interpretation of Figure 6 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA and isolation by distance\n\n\n\nNote that samples from the same country are plotted in the same colour, and samples that are genetically similar will fall close together on the plot.\n\nDo you see any examples of genetically similar samples that are all from the same country? These will represent one local population of the same species. This is what we expect from a local population that is one species.\nAnswer: Yes, Panama is the best example. We see many samples from Panama (blue) that are close together on the PCA plot, and so genetically related.\nDo you see any examples of the opposite: genetically similar samples that are close together on the PCA plot, with different colours showing that they are from different countries?\nAnswer: Yes, there is a cluster of genetically-related strains where the blue dashed line cross each other, that are from different countries.\nHow can we interpret the finding that there are genetically similar individuals living in different countries? It might help to think about this with respect to human populations.\nAnswer: This suggests that there has been migration of Leishmania parasites between countries. This could be due to movement of infected people, or (less likely) the movement of infected animals that are reservoirs of the parasite.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. PCA clustering of only the Leishmania strains we collected from Manaus. The PCA axes are the same as Figure 5 above. The blue dashed lines will help with interpretation compared to Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA and species in Manaus\n\n\n\n\nSince samples that are genetically similar will fall close together on the plot, does it look like all the samples from Manaus are the same species?\nAnswer: No, certainly not. This is consistent with what we observe in the phylogeny.\nWhat does this tell us about the causes of genetic differentiation between species?\nAnswer: While species may have evolved in isolation, they now co-exist in Manaus. We do see hybrids on occasion, but generally the species remain distinct, even when they are in the same location.\nIn other words, why are all these Leishmania samples from Manaus not interbreeding and becoming more genetically similar?\nAnswer: There appears to be some kind of reproductive barrier between species, preventing them from interbreeding extensively. This could be due to the sand fly vectors, or some other ecological factor.\nCan you guess what species are present in Manaus, based on the coordinates of species in previous PCA plots?\nAnswer: Yes, we can see that there are samples that look like L. guyanensis, L. naiffi and L. peruviana.\nIs the idea that there are different Leishmania species in Manaus that we obtain from the PCA plots consistent with the phylogeny we looked at earlier?\nAnswer: Yes."

In this workshop, we’ll use genome data to investigate these questions.\nIn Figure 1 below, each box represents a population that contains many individuals. Red and blue boxes represent two species. Some regions have hybrids (mixed colours), and some do not.

    "text": "2.2 The topic for today\nIn this workshop, we’ll look at new genome data from Leishmania parasites collected in the Amazon. Leishmania are single-celled protozoan parasites that infect mammals, including people. They have two copies of each chromosome (diploid) and reproduce sexually (they undergo meiosis).\nWe’ll focus on Leishmania guyanensis and closely related species found in South America. Together they form a species complex called Viannia—closely related species that can sometimes interbreed where their ranges overlap.\nThese parasites cause cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a skin disease that leads to long-lasting sores. CL is zoonotic, meaning it mostly circulates in wild animals; humans are infected but probably play a small role in maintaining the parasite population.\nBecause Viannia parasites infect many native mammals in South America, they are probably deeply embedded in the region’s ecology.\n\n2.2.1 Leishmania are spread by sand flies\nThree facts about sand flies are important for today:\n\nSand flies are mainly found in forests or forest edges (not in sand on the beach).\nThey are not strong flyers, so they don’t carry Leishmania parasites very long distances.\nThe different sand fly species, and even populations within species, have their own ecological niches and characteristics.\n\nFor example, certain populations of sand flies carry some species of Leishmania, but not others."

The analysis is being carried out at the University of York, working with colleagues in Manaus, Brazil—a large city on the Amazon River surrounded by the Amazon Rainforest. Because the Amazon is so biodiverse, several Viannia species may be present there.\nParasites were isolated from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and grown in the lab to extract DNA. We then sequenced the DNA from 70+ parasites using short-read (Illumina) sequencing.\nFrom these genomes, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—tiny differences at single DNA letters. To add context, we also included public data for related Viannia species from the European Nucleotide Archive. A short summary of the computational steps is at the end of this document.\nFor this workshop, all you need to know is that we have SNP data from:\n\n71 Leishmania strains collected in Manaus (most likely to be L. guyanensis)\n21 L. braziliensis strains from various locations in Brazil\n25 L. panamensis strains from Panama\n34 L. peruviana strains from Peru\none L. shawi strain from Brazil\n\nWe’ll use these data to explore species, populations, and mixing (hybridization) within the Viannia group."

    "text": "3.1 Exploring the data\nIn this workshop we will explore the results we generated. We will look at three ways to visualise population structure.\n\n3.1.1 Population genomic data files\nWhile genomes contain many types of polymorphisms, population genomic analysis often uses only single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. This is because SNPs are very abundant and have properties that make them easier to model mathematically.\nSNPs and other polymorphisms are affected by many processes, such as genetic drift, migration, selection and recombination. However, SNP data can be represented relatively simply as a table.\nThe standard format for representing SNP data is called VCF (Variant Call Format). Here is a small example of what a VCF file looks like.\n#CHROM  POS REF ALT Lg1 Lg2 Lg3 Lg4\n01  2177    A   G   0/1 1/1 1/1 0/1\n01  2636    G   A   0/0 0/1 0/1 0/0\n01  9844    G   A   0/1 0/0 0/0 0/0\n...\n35  9999    G   A   1/1 0/0 0/1 0/0\nIt is almost like a table that we could load into Excel, where each row indicates a position in the genome, and columns contain information about that position.\nIt has a header line:\n#CHROM POS REF ALT\nThis indicates that the first column is the chromosome number (#CHROM), the second column is the position on that chromosome (POS), the third column is the reference allele (REF), and the fourth column is the alternative allele (ALT).\nAfter this, we have the genotypes for each sample. In this example, there are four samples:\nLg1 Lg2 Lg3 Lg4\nAfter this, we have the genotypes for the strains that are in the VCF (four in this case). They are coded as 0 for the reference allele (A) and 1 for the alternative allele (G). So for an A/G polymorphism:\n\nAA is coded as 0/0\nAG is coded as 0/1\nGG is coded as 1/1\n\nThe population genomics community has developed many software tools that process these data to extract information (no tool does it all). In this workshop we will look at a phylogenetic tree, principal components analysis (PCA), and a STRUCTURE plot. These are all used to describe population structure and detect hybrids between populations or between species."

    "section": "3.2 The phylogeny",
    "text": "3.2 The phylogeny\nA phylogenetic tree is a good first look at how similar or different many samples are. But when individuals mix between populations or species (hybridisation), a simple branching tree can be misleading.\nThink of a tree of people grouped by ancestry. Where would you place someone with one parent from Spain and one from Fiji? They don’t fit neatly on a single branch with the Spanish and the Fijians. The same display issue can happen in nature when populations interbreed.\nTo handle this, we used a network approach (a splits network made with the software SplitsTree) that can show conflicting signals in the data—like those caused by mixing between populations or species.\nBelow is our SplitsTree network. There are many samples, so coloured dots cluster tightly. The Manaus samples are dark blue. Most cluster near Leishmania guyanensis at the top. We marked the Manaus samples that do not with arrows.\n Figure 2: A SplitsTree phylogeny. The overall phylogeny is in the centre, and we zoom in to various clades (groups of related samples) around the edges. Each dot is a sample, coloured by species. The dark blue dots are samples we collected from Manaus, Brazil.\n\n3.2.1 Interpreting the phylogeny\nNow spend some time discussing the SplitsTree phylogeny, using the discussion points below as a guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: phylogeny\n\n\n\n\nFrom this figure, do the Viannia species look clearly separated, or do some overlap?\nAnswer: Yes, the species are mostly separated, but there looks to be a hybrid in the inset on the right.\nA few Manaus samples don’t cluster with L. guyanensis. What could explain that?\nAnswer: Some of the Manaus samples are different species. So there must be several species in this location.\n\n\nWhat might this suggest about the causes of CL in the Amazon (e.g., multiple species, local ecology, host/vector differences)?\n\n\nAnswer: There are multiple species. They might interbreed in this location, but we cannot see this in the current phylogeny. We cannot tell anything about local ecology, host/vector differences from this phylogeny.\n\n\nLook at the L. peruviana–L. braziliensis area (red box). One strain sits between the two. What could that indicate?\n\n\nAnswer: This is a probably a hybrid.\n\n\nExamine the data from the single L. shawi sample (light blue). Does its branch look unusually short? Remember: branch lengths indicate the genetic distance between strains or species.\n\n\nAnswer: Yes, it does look short. This is suspicious, but it is difficult to diagnose from this representation of the data. This shows a limitation of phylogeny."

    "section": "3.3 Principal components clustering",
    "text": "3.3 Principal components clustering\nPopulation structure is an important facet of most (if not all) species. Populations sometimes split into species, and all natural selection begins within a population. So when we start to examine the genetic diversity of a species, it is wise to look at population structure.\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) is a useful tool for understanding population structure. PCA reduces the variables in our data set (thousands of SNPs in rows, and many individuals in columns), while preserving a lot of the information about population structure.\nA simple way to interpret PCA data is to consider that the distance between two individuals on a two-dimensional PCA plot represents the genetic distance between those samples. So, if they are close on the plot, they are close genetically. If they are distant on the plot, they are distant genetically. We would expect individuals from within a population or species to fall close to each other on a PCA plot.\nFirst look at Figure 3 below. This shows PCA clustering of all the other Viannia species, apart from the samples we collected from Manaus. Discuss with the people at your table:\n\nDo the species cluster genetically?\nDo L. peruviana and L. braziliensis really look like two different species?\n\nNote: The blue dashed lines are a guide to the eye to help you see the clusters.\n Figure 3. PCA clustering of Viannia species from throughout South America.\nNow look at Figure 4, which shows PCA clustering of Viannia species from throughout South America (on the left), and those that were collected from Manaus (on the right). Note that the PC axes are on the same scale here.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. PCA clustering of all the Leishmania samples from throughout South America (left), and those that were collected from Manaus (right)\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Interpreting principal component plots\nUse the discussion points below to discuss the PCA plots with the people at your table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA (species)\n\n\n\n\nDoes it look like the samples that came from Manaus are all the same species?\nAnswer: No certainly not. Some are in the same position as L. guyanensis, but others are from different species.\nSince the positions on the PCA plot separate the species, does this help to identify the species from Manaus?\nAnswer: Yes, some are L. guyanensis, some are L. naiffi and others L. peruviana.\nWhat does this tell you about the causes of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Amazon region?\nAnswer: Since all these samples were collected from cutaneous leishmaniasis patients, this disease is caused by at least three different Leishmania species.\nSince Leishmania are single-celled organisms and they all cause a similar disease, population genomics is the only way to identify which sample belongs to which species. Why would we not merely use PCR to identify the species?\nAnswer: Because we do see hybrids. If we used PCR, we might misidentify hybrids as one species or the other, depending on which gene we amplified. Population genomics allows us to see the whole genome, so we can identify hybrids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Principal components clustering 2: geography and genetics\nWe can look at the PC plots another way, simply by colouring the samples according to where they came from (geography).\nBecause sand flies that carry Leishmania do not fly very far, it is possible that geographic distance is the main factor that determines the genetic distance between Leishmania populations. This concept is called isolation by distance.\nThe Leishmania parasites we have genome data for come from Brazil, Peru and Panama, which are very far apart, so we might expect to see isolation by distance in the PCA plot.\nNote that in Figure 5 below: - the colour of each point indicates the location where the sample was collected - the position on the PCA plot indicates how closely related each sample is. If two strains sit close together on the plot, they are closely related genetically.\n\n\nFigure 5. PCA clustering of Viannia species from throughout South America. The blue dashed lines are not important here, but will help with interpretation of Figure 6 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA and isolation by distance\n\n\n\nNote that samples from the same country are plotted in the same colour, and samples that are genetically similar will fall close together on the plot.\n\nDo you see any examples of genetically similar samples that are all from the same country? These will represent one local population of the same species. This is what we expect from a local population that is one species.\nAnswer: Yes, Panama is the best example. We see many samples from Panama (blue) that are close together on the PCA plot, and so genetically related.\nDo you see any examples of the opposite: genetically similar samples that are close together on the PCA plot, with different colours showing that they are from different countries?\nAnswer: Yes, there is a cluster of genetically-related strains where the blue dashed line cross each other, that are from different countries.\nHow can we interpret the finding that there are genetically similar individuals living in different countries? It might help to think about this with respect to human populations.\nAnswer: This suggests that there has been migration of Leishmania parasites between countries. This could be due to movement of infected people, or (less likely) the movement of infected animals that are reservoirs of the parasite.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. PCA clustering of only the Leishmania strains we collected from Manaus. The PCA axes are the same as Figure 5 above. The blue dashed lines will help with interpretation compared to Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA and species in Manaus\n\n\n\n\nSince samples that are genetically similar will fall close together on the plot, does it look like all the samples from Manaus are the same species?\nAnswer: No, certainly not. This is consistent with what we observe in the phylogeny.\nWhat does this tell us about the causes of genetic differentiation between species?\nAnswer: While species may have evolved in isolation, they now co-exist in Manaus. We do see hybrids on occasion, but generally the species remain distinct, even when they are are in the same location.\nIn other words, why are all these Leishmania samples from Manaus not interbreeding and becoming more genetically similar?\nAnswer: There appears to be some kind of reproductive barrier between species, preventing them from interbreeding extensively. This could be due to the sand fly vectors, or some other ecological factor.\nCan you guess what species are present in Manaus, based on the coordinates of species in previous PCA plots?\nAnswer: Yes, we can see that there are samples that look like L. guyanensis, L. naiffi and L. peruviana.\nIs the idea that there are different Leishmania species in Manaus that we obtain from the PCA plots consistent with the phylogeny we looked at earlier?\nAnswer: Yes."

These species were all relatively closely related.\nIn this workshop, we continue looking at Leishmania data, but the observations we make will apply to any group of species.\nThis time, we look at how more distantly-related Leishmania species. We know from the molecular clock concept, that if two species are dissimilar genetically, this is because mutations have accumulated over time. Figure 2 below shows that the molecular clock also holds over very long periods of time.\n Figure 1. Evidence that molecular clock causes divergence between species over both short and long periods of time. Panel a: We saw from the influenza virus workshop that mutations occurred within influenza viruses at a regular rate with time over merely a fee decades. Panel b: This also occurs over long periods of time. For example, geologists know that the pacific islands of Hawaii have been formed over millions of years, emerging one after the other over thr last 5 mission years. Evolutionary biologists know that both honeycreeper birds and Drosophila fruit flies have populated these islands during this time, and from the geological data, we know how long ago they diverged. If we look at genetic data from the Yp1 gene in honeycreepers (Panel c) and the Cytb gene from fruit flies (Panel d), we observe a very consistent correlation between genetic distance (vertical axis) and time between island formation (horizontal axis). Just like the data you saw from the influenza virus, it looks very much like there is a constant rate of genetic divergence with time, this time over millions of years. Plots b-d are from Bromham and Penny, 2003."

Sometimes these are called silent mutations.\nnon-synonymous: mutations that do change the protein sequence.\n\nWe expect the synonymous mutations to be more or less neutral (ie: not subject to selection), because they don’t change the protein, so we can think of these as representing what occurs without selection, like a control.\nThe non-synonymous mutations that do change the protein, will often be subject to selection. Since most new mutations are harmful, we expect that many non-synonymous mutations will be removed by purifying selection. Very occasionally, a non-synonymous mutation will be beneficial, and will be favoured by positive selection.\nTo understand selection within a gene, we can calculate ratio of non-synonymous (selection) / synonymous (control) ratio. We will call this the N/S ratio. I show some toy examples of N/S ratios in Table 2 below.\n\nNB: More complex analyses call this ratio the dN/dS ratio, or the Ka/Ks ratio.\n\n\n\nN/S ratio examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene\nsynonymous SNPs\nnon-synonymous SNPs\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nA\n1\n10\nfar fewer non-synonymous than synonymous SNPs: purifying selection has removed many non-synonymous SNPs\n\n\nB\n10\n11\nnon-synonymous and synonymous SNPs about the same: no selection\n\n\nC\n20\n10\nmore non-synonymous than synonymous SNPs: positive selection has selected for non-synonymous SNPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the N/S ratios\n\n\n\n\nGene A: The N/S ratio is very low (N=1, S=10, N/S = 0.1).

Since we observe the same number of non-synonymous (amino-acid changing) SNPs as synonymous SNPs it is likely that no selection has been acting on this gene.\nGene C: The N/S ratio is high (N=20, S=10, N/S = 2). Since we observe more non-synonymous (amino-acid changing) SNPs than synonymous SNPs strong positive selection has probably been acting on this gene\n\n\n\nNB: These are toy examples.

We’ll examine this now.\nTo study this, we wil now compare how similar the proteins are between between L. donovani and L. braziliensis. You can see that these are quite distant on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). We don’t know exactly how long ago they diverged, but it will be much longer ago that the within-species differences we saw earlier, so perhaps 100,000 years or even millions of years ago.\nTo compare the proteins between these two species, I calculated the percent identity of each L. donovani and L. braziliensis ortholog (ie: what percent of amino acids in the alignment are the same). The percent identities range from 22% to 100%. What is remarkable here is that smoe proteins have change an enormous amount over this time, while others have not changed at all, showing that over evolutionary time, genes change at different rates.\nOf the ~8,000 orthologous proteins I selected the most rapidly evolving 1500 genes (lowest percent identity) and the most slowly evolving 1500 genes (highest percent identity), and ran gene enrichment analyses on both sets of genes.\n\n3.5.1 Deep time analysis: first look at the results\nLet’s look at the most slowly evolving genes first.

To recap, quantitative traits are often described as complex traits, because they are affected by genetic variation in many genes. The genetic variants in the genes each account for a small proportion of the trait variation. We usually assume that the contribute in an additive way (rather than more complex ways).\nOne good way to identify loci controlling quantitative traits is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study, or GWAS. GWAS experiments use diversity panels of individuals to identify genetic markers that are significantly associated with a trait of interest.\nUsing a diversity panel instead of a bi parental mapping population ensures that linkage disequilibrium is low (bits of co-inherited DNA are small), and therefore resolution is high (QTL sizes are small), which helps to narrow down the regions containing the genes controlling the trait. They also capture much more genetic variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative traits and evolution\n\n\n\nMost traits are quantitative, and are caused by multiple genetic variants.

    "text": "2.2 Fission yeast\nIn this workshop we’ll use data from the fission yeast Schizosacharomyces pombe, which is a model species for cell biology. You can read more here about S. pombe here.\nWhen fission yeast is not being used in labs as a model species for cell biology, it usually grows on fruit. It is most often found in high-sugar fruits or in fermented beverages (wine, beer, and quite often in cachaça in Brazil).\n\n\nFigure 1. The fission yeast Schizosacharomyces pombe.  Fission yeast is an excellent model system. It is easy to grow in the laboratory, easy to transform, and it has a very small genome (12 Mb). It has ~5,000 protein coding genes, and ~1500 non-coding RNAs. It is haploid. Fission yeast and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not closely related fungi, so study of both has contributed vastly to our understanding of molecular biology, and to evolutionary biology and quantitative genetics.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 GWAS for yeast\nGWAS is usually used for human or crop traits, but of course we can apply this method to any recombing sexually-recombining eukaryotic species where we have trait data and polymorphism data (eg: SNPs).\nThe data we will use is from two papers from Nature Genetics, and Nature Communications. These articles described the genetic diversity of 160 strains of this species by sequencing their genomes. We also measured over 200 traits.\nIn this workshop we will examine some GWAS results for four traits, and think about what these results could mean for the evolution of this species.\n\n\n2.4 The traits\nThe traits we will look at today are:\nGrowth in 400mM NaCl The growth rate of the strains in 400 mM salt. This could be important if strains grew in fruit near the sea, for example.\nGrowth at an elevated temperature The growth rate of the strains at 40 degrees centigrade. This is quite warm for this yeast, so it’s a stressful condition.\nMaximal cell density in rich media This trait measures how well each strain grows, if it’s given plenty of sugar and other resources.\nGlucose/fructose utlisation level in wine How much of the glucose and fructose sugars each strain used in grape must (which is used to make wine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraits and trade-offs\n\n\n\nA high value in one of these traits could be adaptive one environment. But it ma be sub-optimal in another environment. Also, optimising one trait may limit another trait. This could be vbause one mutation may result in multiple changes, or the alleles that influence two traits are closely linked.\n\n\n\n\n3 Exercises\n\n3.1 Exploring the data\nFirst, clear all the previous data you may have in R, set your working directory, and load the new data.\nTo set a working directory you can either use a command (as below), or use the menus;\nSession &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory.\n\n#clear all the previous data\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#set working directory\n#your working directory will be different!\nsetwd(\"/Users/dj757/gd/modules/BIO56I/workshops/gwas\")\n\n#load the data\nload(url(\"http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dj757/BIO00056I/data/gwas-data.Rda\"))\n\nAfter loading this data you’ll then have four data frames of data called gluc, heat, rich and salt. Each of these data frames contains the GWAS results for one trait. Let’s start by looking at one table, salt.\nTry these commands to see what the contain:\n\n#examine what is in the salt data frame\nhead(salt)\nnrow(salt)\nsummary(salt)\nView(salt)\n\nThis table contains the output from GWAS program called LDAK. This is one of man software tools that run GWAS analysis. It describes the association of each SNP with the trait of salt tolerance.\nEach row of the table contains information about a SNP. For our purposes, the important columns are:\n\nWald_P, the P-value, the probability that this SNP is associated with this trait\nChr, which chromosome the SNP is on\nBP, the position of the SNP in the chromosome\nEffect_size, how strongly this variant effects the trait\n\nThe effect size of the variant estimates the proportion of trait variation that is explained by this SNP. From our understanding of The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, we know that most variants are selectively neutral. ie: they have little or no effect on fitness.\nGiven this, we might expect that most variants have small, or no effect, on traits.\n\n\n3.2 Manhattan plot\nA Manhattan plot is a standard way of viewing GWAS results. They are named Manhattan plots because they resemble the skyline of a highrise city, such as Manhattan Island (New York).\nManhattan plots show the position of the SNP on the x axis, and the p-value of the association on the y axis. P-alues are plotted as -log10(P), so that very small p-values end up at the top of the plot, and stand out.\nThe code below will make a Manhattan plot for the salt trait.\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #make a subset of SNPs from this chromosome\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      #plot these\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\",j),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      #draw a threshold line\n      #SNPs above this line are statistically associated with the trait\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\nWe see a small number* of very low P-values, with -log10 values they are at the top** of the y axis. For these, there is strong support that the affect the trait.\nThen, there are a large number with P-values of around 0.1 or greater. These are at the *bottom** of the y axis. There is weak support that the affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-log10 scale plotting\n\n\n\nNote that we use plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P) to plot the Wald_P P-values on a negative log scale. This means that very significant P-values (eg: P = 1 x 10-9.5), will show as high points on the plot (eg: at position 9.5 on the vertical y axis in this case).\n\n\nAll the non-signifcant SNPs (eg: P = 0.1, which is P = 1 x 10-1) will be at the bottom of the y axis. If most variants have small effects, or no effects on traits, there will be many of these.\nThis shows how GWAS relates to other areas of evolutionary theory.\n\n\n3.3 SNP effect sizes\nThe strength of the association between the genotype and the phenotype is related to the effect size of the variant (how strongly it affects the trait). Some alleles will affect the trait very strongly, others not so much. Now let’s look at how large the effect sizes are, by making a histogram of all the effect sizes.\n\nhist(salt$Effect_size,br=30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondider this result\n\n\n\n\nWhat this histogram tell you about SNP effect sizes?\nIs this consistent with The Neutral Theory of Moleclar Evolution?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 How does this influence evolution?\nThe effect size of a variant is the proportion of the phenotypic variance that the SNP explains. We can see that most of the effect sizes are very small. Most are smaller than 0.05, meaning that they produce an effect that is much smaller than 5% of the trait. They have tiny effects on the trait.\nAt this point let’s think about how such tiny effect alleles might influence evolutionary change.\nA selective sweep is a process where a beneficial mutation becomes fixed in a population rapidly, removing the genetic variation around the selected allele. Ask yourself:\n\nIf a trait is caused by small number of large effect mutations, would we expect to observe a selective sweep?\nWhat about a trait with a large number of mutations with very tiny effects?\nWould we expect to observe a selective sweep if a large effect mutation lies very close to a deleterious allele?\n\n\n\n3.5 Another trait: glucose & fructose use\nIn a vineyard environment, where this yeast grows, it will be an advantage to be able to metabolise the glucose and fructose in the rotting fruit. The glucose/fructose use is in the gluc data frame.\nAgain, we will look at the P-values Wald_P and how much each SNP is predcited to affect the trait (Effect_size).\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      temp = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\", j, \"Gluc\"),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n\n\nAgain, we see a small number of very low P-values, with -log10 values they are at the top of the y axis. For these, there is strong support that the affect the trait.\nThen, there are a large number with P-values of around 0.1 or greater. These are at the bottom of the y axis. There is weak support that the affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\nNow, make a histogram of the effect sizes:\n\nhist(gluc$Effect_size)\n\n\n\n3.6 Looking at two traits\nSpecies are not able to adapt simply to one condition, like heat or salt stress, because the natural environment is complex, and it changes from day to day. As a thought experiment, we will consider this using the fission yeast data.\nWe will compare the two Manhattan plots by plotting them on top of each other. We will plot the salt results in black, and the glucose metabolism results in red, and write the plot output to a pdf file. This pdf will appear in your working directory.\n\n#open the pdf writer\npdf(\"GWAS-plot3.pdf\",width=60)\n#set up the plot layout\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n#loop through chromosomes\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #plot the salt GWAS points (black dots)\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),main = \"\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\")\n      \n      #add the glucose/fructose GWAS points (red crosses)\n      temp2 = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      points(temp2$BP, -log10(temp2$Wald_P),main = \"gluc\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\",col=2,pch=3)\n      \n      #add the significance threshold\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n#close the pdf writer\ndev.off()\n\nNow find the pdf called GWAS-plot3.pdf and take a look.\n\n3.6.1 Might mutations for two traits conflict?\nLook at that significant peak on chromosome 3, at position ~1,500,000. Remember, this will have a large effect size. See how there is also an important variant for glucose & fructose use on chromosome 3, near the same position.\nLet’s consider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex (which all environments are). In this case, we consider an environment which is salty, but has plenty of fructose. A coastal vineyard, for example.\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhaplotypes\n\n\n\nIn a physical sense a haplotype is a length of DNA from one chromosome. For diploid species such as yourself tht have a paternal and a maternal chromosome, this is easy to understand.\nBut for fission yeast is haploid (one copy of each chromosome), what does this mean? We can think of different haplotypes as different versions of the chromosome that exist within the population. Each will carry it’s own SNPs.\nThrough meiotic recombination, haplotypes will be mixed. But SNPs that are very close together on the chromosome will not become separated very often. So they will usually travel together.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Haplotype problems\nCondider these situations:\n\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\nWhat might happen if the two helpful alleles are on different (opposing) haplotypes?\n\nThe figures below will help to explain.\n Figure 2. Beneficial alleles on one haplotype. Would there be any ‘conflict’ here?\n\n Figure 3. Beneficial alleles on two different haplotypes. What might happen here? What would the problem be?\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Summary: what we have learned\nThis workshop used data from fission yeast, but the principles apply to quantitative traits in general. Some general principles we can obtain are:\n\nMost SNPs do not strongly associate with traits.\nMost SNPs have very small effects on traits, but some do have detectable effects.\nSNPs do not affect all traits at once. Some SNPs affect one trait, some affect another.\nGenetic variants, like SNPs, ‘travel’ through time and space in haplotypes\n\n\n\n5 After the workshop: exam style questions\nIn exam questions, we often ask you to apply principles we have learned in workshops to other species, or other situations. Here are some examples to think about. Thinking about these situations will help to improve our grasp of the principes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of quantitative genetics\n\n\n\n\nMost SNPs have no effect, or very small effects, on traits.\nSNPs that do affect traits, are generally responsible for less than 5% of the trait variation.\nEffect sizes are also small for other genetic variants, such as transposon insertions, duplications/deletions and so on.\nGenetic variants can affect one trait, or several.\nIn the short term, selection occurs on haplotypes, but over time recombination will separate linked variants.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.1 Question 1. Why do we observe that most genetic variants have small effects on traits?\nHint: There are two was to anwser this one. a) To think about what we would expect to happen over time to variants that do have large effects. Consider those with large negative (deleterious) effects first, then those that are large and advantagous. b) To consider The Neutral Theory of Moleclar Evolution and molecular biology. If you change one amino acid in one protein, how much would you expect this to affect fitness? What about one synonymous mutation?\n\n\n5.0.2 Question 2. Imagine we observe that a fungicde-resistant fungus is spread though a country, destroying crops.\nWe know that this fungicde-resistance is new, so we hypothesise that a new mutation has occured. We can culture this fungus in the laboratory and measure their fungicde-resistance. How could we use quantiative genetics and population genetics together to find out what is happening?"

    "text": "3.1 How we generated gene gain/loss data\nThis is comparative genomics data. We download the sequences of all the protein-coding genes of each of these species, from the databse TriTrypDB. We then found clusters of orthologous groups (ie: groups of orthologs), using the OrthoFinder software. OrthoFinder identifies the clusters of orthologous groups. The plot above does not show when a species has multiple copies of a gene in an orthologous group (paralogs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthologs, paralogs and orthologous groups\n\n\n\nTwo genes are orthologs if they are in different species and have evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation. Orthologous genes often retain the same function in the course of evolution.\nParalogs are like orthologs, in that they have evolved from a common ancestral gene, but they are in the same species and have arisen by gene duplication.\nOrthologous groups are groups of genes from different species that are all orthologous to each other. An orthologous group may contain one gene from each species, or it may contain multiple genes from some species (paralogs).\n\n\nWe can compare the cladogram of the Trypanosomatid species to Figure 2 (below), which is a phylogenetic tree drawn using the single nucleotide differences in ~1000 single copy genes (genes that every species has exactly one of). This phylogenetic tree will be very reliable, as it is created from tens of thousands of single nucleotide differences.\nYou will recall that we examined a phylogenetic tree of influenza viruses in workshop 5. The influenza virus phylogenetic tree spanned only a few years, whereas this Trypanosomatid tree spans millions of years.\nBut remember that within-population process (especially genetic drift and natural selection) give rise to the differences between species regardless of timescale. A big difference is that we expect many more differences to have accumulated over millions of years than over a few years.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. A phylogenetic tree of the same Trypanosomatid species, drawn using single nucleotide differences in ~1000 single copy genes. This tree has the same species as the gene presence/absence heatmap (Figure 1). Species names are written slightly differently, because Figure 1 indicates the name of the strain used."

There is disagreement about whether this civilization domesticated goats (if they were goats) or if they merely caught and ate wild goats.\nLuckily, in this scenario, we can occasionally obtain small amounts of DNA from the bones of sheep (or goats) at Çatalhöyük and Aşıklı Höyük. The samples we consider are described below. Note that while this is a hypothetical example, studies of ancient civilizations do use DNA and population genomics.\nFor example, the study of Population genomics of the Viking world used population genomics extensively. Çatalhöyük is older, so in our scenario, we assume the quality and quantity of DNA is much lower."

There isn’t much, but you can sequence it. You do, and it is disappointing - the sequence reads map to only ten tiny regions in 0.5% of the goat genome and 0.4% of the sheep genome. They don’t have the funds or the samples to obtain any more.\nThe challenge is to explain what this might mean if the SNPs show the samples are more like sheep, more like goats, or in between, and if they traded sheep and goats with each other, or merely caught wild sheep and goats."

    "text": "2.1 Background\nIn the lectures, we learnt about quantitative traits and how to analyse them. To recap, quantitative traits are often described as complex traits because they are affected by genetic variation in many genes. The genetic variants in those genes each account for a small proportion of the trait variation. We usually assume that they contribute in an additive way (rather than more complex ways).\nOne good way to identify loci controlling quantitative traits is to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWAS experiments use diversity panels of individuals to identify genetic markers that are significantly associated with a trait of interest.\nUsing a diversity panel instead of a biparental mapping population ensures that linkage disequilibrium is low (segments of co-inherited DNA are small), and therefore resolution is high (QTL sizes are small), which helps to narrow down the regions containing the genes controlling the trait. Diversity panels also capture much more genetic variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative traits and evolution\n\n\n\nMost traits are quantitative, and are caused by multiple genetic variants. This means that:\n\nWe expect traits to adapt gradually, as a few variants change\nWe do not expect to observe many strong selective sweeps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlossary\n\n\n\nTechnical definitions for this workshop.\n\nSchizosaccharomyces pombe: Fission yeast; a haploid, unicellular fungus widely used as a model organism.\nGWAS: Genome-wide association study; a statistical approach to associate genetic variants with traits across a genome.\ntrait: A measurable characteristic (phenotype), such as growth rate at high temperature.\nManhattan plot: A plot of genomic position (x) versus −log10(P-value) (y) showing association signals across the genome.\nQTL: Quantitative trait locus; a genomic region containing variants that influence a quantitative trait.\nhaplotype: A set of genetic variants along a single chromosome that tend to be inherited together.\nselective sweep: Rapid increase in frequency of a beneficial allele, reducing nearby genetic variation via linkage."

    "text": "2.2 Fission yeast\nIn this workshop we will use data from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is a model species for cell biology. You can read more about S. pombe here.\nWhen fission yeast is not being used in labs as a model species for cell biology, it usually grows on fruit. It is most often found in high-sugar fruits or in fermented beverages (wine, beer, and quite often in cachaça in Brazil).\n\n\nFigure 1. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Fission yeast is an excellent model system. It is easy to grow in the laboratory, easy to transform, and it has a very small genome (12 Mb). It has ~5,000 protein-coding genes and ~1,500 non-coding RNAs. It is haploid. Fission yeast and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not closely related fungi, so study of both has contributed greatly to our understanding of molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and quantitative genetics.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 GWAS for yeast\nGWAS is often used for human or crop traits, but we can apply this method to any sexually recombining eukaryotic species for which we have trait data and polymorphism data (e.g., SNPs).\nThe data we will use come from two papers: Nature Genetics and Nature Communications. These articles described the genetic diversity of 160 strains of this species by sequencing their genomes, and measured over 200 traits.\nIn this workshop we will examine GWAS results for four traits and consider what they could mean for the evolution of this species.\n\n\n2.4 The traits\nThe traits we will look at today are:\nGrowth in 400 mM NaCl The growth rate of the strains in 400 mM salt. This could be important if strains grew in fruit near the sea or in salty substrates.\nGrowth at elevated temperature The growth rate of the strains at 40 °C. This is quite warm for this yeast, so it is a stressful condition.\nMaximal cell density in rich medium This trait measures how well each strain grows when given plenty of sugar and other resources.\nGlucose/fructose utilisation in wine How much of the glucose and fructose each strain used in grape must (used to make wine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraits and trade-offs\n\n\n\nA high value in one of these traits could be adaptive in one environment but suboptimal in another. Also, optimising one trait may limit another trait. This could be because one mutation results in multiple changes, or the alleles that influence two traits are closely linked.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Exercises\n\n3.1 Exploring the data\nFirst, clear all the previous data you may have in R, set your working directory, and load the GWAS data.\nTo set a working directory you can either use a command (as below), or use the menus;\nSession &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory.\n\n#clear all the previous data\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#set working directory\n#your working directory will be different!\nsetwd(\"/Users/dj757/gd/modules/BIO56I/workshops/gwas\")\n\n#load the data\nload(url(\"http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dj757/BIO00056I/data/gwas-data.Rda\"))\n\nAfter loading these data you will have four data frames called gluc, heat, rich, and salt. Each contains the GWAS results for one trait. Start by looking at salt.\nTry these commands to see what they contain:\n\n#examine what is in the salt data frame\nhead(salt)\nnrow(salt)\nsummary(salt)\nView(salt)\n\nThis table contains the output from a GWAS tool called LDAK. This is one of many software tools that run GWAS analyses. It describes the association of each SNP with the trait of salt tolerance.\nEach row of the table contains information about one SNP. For our purposes, the important columns are:\n\nWald_P, the P-value, the probability that this SNP is associated with this trait\nChr, which chromosome the SNP is on\nBP, the position of the SNP in the chromosome\nEffect_size, how strongly this variant affects the trait\n\nThe effect size of the variant estimates the proportion of trait variation that is explained by this SNP. From our understanding of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, we know that most variants are selectively neutral, i.e., they have little or no effect on fitness.\nGiven this, we might expect that most variants have small, or no, effects on traits.\n\n\n\n3.2 Manhattan plot\nA Manhattan plot is a standard way of viewing GWAS results. They are named Manhattan plots because they resemble the skyline of a high-rise city, such as Manhattan (New York).\nManhattan plots show the position of the SNP on the x-axis, and the P-value of the association on the y-axis. P-values are plotted as −log10(P), so that very small P-values end up at the top of the plot and stand out.\nThe code below will make a Manhattan plot for the salt trait.\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #make a subset of SNPs from this chromosome\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      #plot these\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\",j),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      #draw a threshold line\n      #SNPs above this line are statistically associated with the trait\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: Manhattan plot\n\n\n\n\nWhere are the strongest association signals located (do peaks cluster on particular chromosomes)?\nWhy are most points close to the bottom of the plot? What does this tell you about polygenic traits?\nHow does the −log10(P) scale aid interpretation compared to plotting raw P-values?\nWhat biological processes could lead to a few tall peaks versus many low signals (e.g., selection, drift, mutation rate, linkage)?\n\n\n\nYou will usually see a small number of very low P-values; with large −log10 values they sit at the top of the y-axis. For these, there is strong support that they affect the trait.\nYou will also see many SNPs with P-values around 0.1 or greater. These are at the bottom of the y-axis. There is weak support that they affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−log10 scale plotting\n\n\n\nNote that we use plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P)) to plot the Wald_P P-values on a negative log scale. This means that very significant P-values (e.g., P = 1 × 10^−9.5) will show as high points on the plot (e.g., at position 9.5 on the vertical y-axis in this case).\n\n\nAll the non-significant SNPs (e.g., P = 0.1, which is 1 × 10^−1) will be at the bottom of the y-axis. If most variants have small or no effects on traits, there will be many of these.\nThis illustrates polygenic architecture: many variants with small effects and a few with larger effects.\n\n\n3.3 SNP effect sizes\nThe strength of the association between genotype and phenotype relates to the effect size (how strongly the variant affects the trait). Some alleles affect the trait strongly; most do not. Now make a histogram of all the effect sizes.\n\nhist(salt$Effect_size,br=30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: effect sizes\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the histogram shape tell you about the distribution of SNP effect sizes?\nHow does this pattern relate to the Neutral Theory (many neutral or near-neutral variants)?\nWhere would you expect to see evidence of purifying selection or positive selection in such a distribution?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 How does this influence evolution?\nEffect size here is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by that SNP. Most effect sizes are very small—often &lt; 0.05—meaning each explains far less than 5% of the trait variance.\nConsider how such tiny-effect alleles influence evolutionary change.\nA selective sweep is a process where a beneficial mutation becomes fixed in a population rapidly, removing the genetic variation around the selected allele.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: selective sweeps and polygenicity\n\n\n\n\nIf a trait is influenced by a few large-effect mutations, how likely is a classic selective sweep and why?\nIf a trait is influenced by many tiny-effect mutations, what evolutionary pattern replaces a sweep? (Think subtle allele frequency shifts.)\nHow can tight linkage to a deleterious allele modify or slow a sweep?\nWhat genomic signatures (e.g., reduced diversity, extended haplotype homozygosity) would differ between oligogenic and highly polygenic adaptation?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Another trait: glucose & fructose use\nIn a vineyard environment, it is advantageous to metabolise glucose and fructose in rotting fruit. Glucose/fructose use is in the gluc data frame.\nAgain, we will look at the P-values (Wald_P) and how much each SNP is predicted to affect the trait (Effect_size).\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      temp = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\", j, \"Gluc\"),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n::: callout-tip\n# Discussion points: second trait comparison\n\n- Do the strongest glucose/fructose association peaks overlap with salt peaks? What could shared loci imply (pleiotropy vs linkage)?\n- Are there trait-specific peaks? What might that say about specialised metabolic pathways?\n- How could environmental context (salinity vs sugar availability) shift which alleles are favoured?\n:::\n\nAgain, you will see a small number of very low P-values at the top of the y-axis (strong support) and many higher P-values at the bottom (weak or no support; tiny or no effect sizes).\n\nNow, make a histogram of the effect sizes:\n\n\nhist(gluc$Effect_size)\n\n\n\n3.6 Looking at two traits\nSpecies cannot adapt to a single condition (e.g., heat or salt) in isolation because environments are complex and variable. As a thought experiment, we will consider this using the fission yeast data.\nWe will compare two Manhattan plots by overlaying them: salt (black) and glucose/fructose metabolism (red). The output PDF will appear in your working directory.\n\n#open the pdf writer\npdf(\"GWAS-plot3.pdf\",width=60)\n#set up the plot layout\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n#loop through chromosomes\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #plot the salt GWAS points (black dots)\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),main = \"\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\")\n      \n      #add the glucose/fructose GWAS points (red crosses)\n      temp2 = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      points(temp2$BP, -log10(temp2$Wald_P),main = \"gluc\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\",col=2,pch=3)\n      \n      #add the significance threshold\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n#close the pdf writer\ndev.off()\n\nNow find the pdf called GWAS-plot3.pdf and take a look.\n\n3.6.1 Might mutations for two traits conflict?\nLook at the significant peak on chromosome 3 (~1,500,000 bp). This likely has a relatively large effect size. There is also an important variant for glucose/fructose use nearby on chromosome 3.\nConsider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex—salty yet fructose-rich (e.g., a coastal vineyard).\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles for both traits are on the same haplotype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaplotypes\n\n\n\nPhysically, a haplotype is a stretch of DNA from one chromosome. In diploids, each individual carries two homologous chromosomes. In haploid S. pombe, different haplotypes are simply different chromosome versions present across the population. Through meiotic recombination haplotypes mix, but SNPs very close together rarely separate, so they tend to travel together.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Haplotype problems\nConsider these situations:\n\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles are on different (opposing) haplotypes?\n\nThe figures below will help to explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: haplotypes and linkage\n\n\n\n\nHow does tight linkage between beneficial alleles influence the speed of joint adaptation?\nWhat evolutionary constraint arises when beneficial alleles are on different haplotypes in low recombination regions?\nHow can recombination rate modulate the resolution of this “conflict” between opposing haplotypes?\nWhich scenario (single vs opposing haplotypes) better facilitates rapid multi-trait optimisation?\n\n\n\n Figure 2. Beneficial alleles on one haplotype. Would there be any conflict here?\n\n Figure 3. Beneficial alleles on two different haplotypes. What might happen here? What is the potential problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Summary: what we have learned\nThis workshop used data from fission yeast, but the principles apply broadly to quantitative traits. Key points:\n\nMost SNPs do not strongly associate with traits.\nMost SNPs have very small effects on traits, but some do have detectable effects.\nSNPs do not affect all traits at once. Some SNPs affect one trait; some affect another.\nGenetic variants, like SNPs, travel through time and space in haplotypes.\n\n\n\n\n5 After the workshop: exam-style questions\nExam questions often ask you to apply workshop principles to other species or scenarios. Reflecting on these helps deepen understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of quantitative genetics\n\n\n\n\nMost SNPs have no effect, or very small effects, on traits.\nSNPs that do affect traits are generally responsible for less than 5% of the trait variation.\nEffect sizes are also small for other genetic variants, such as transposon insertions, duplications/deletions and so on.\nGenetic variants can affect one trait, or several.\nIn the short term, selection occurs on haplotypes, but over time recombination will separate linked variants.\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Question 1 (10 points)\nThis question checks your understanding of quantitative traits and why most variants have small effects.\n\nDefine the difference between a simple (single-gene) trait and a quantitative trait. Give one example of each from this workshop. (2 points)\nThe histogram of SNP effect sizes for the salt trait is heavily skewed towards zero. Describe what this pattern tells us about the distribution of SNP effects in the population. (3 points)\nUsing the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, explain why most SNPs are expected to have little or no effect on fitness. (3 points)\nSuggest one practical way to increase the power of a GWAS to detect very small-effect variants and explain why it helps. (2 points)\n\n\n\n5.2 Question 2 (10 points)\nYou notice that the Manhattan plots for salt tolerance and glucose/fructose utilisation share a peak on chromosome 3, but also have trait-specific peaks.\n\nDescribe what an overlapping peak for both traits suggests about the underlying genetics of those traits. (3 points)\nState one additional analysis you could carry out to test whether the same causal variant influences both traits. (2 points)\nExplain how recombination could help resolve a situation where beneficial alleles for two traits are on different haplotypes. (3 points)\nIdentify one environmental measurement you would collect alongside the genomic data to interpret potential trade-offs between the two traits, and justify your choice. (2 points)"

P-values are plotted as −log10(P), so that very small P-values end up at the top of the plot and stand out.\nThe code below will make a Manhattan plot for the salt trait.\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #make a subset of SNPs from this chromosome\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      #plot these\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\",j),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      #draw a threshold line\n      #SNPs above this line are statistically associated with the trait\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: Manhattan plot\n\n\n\n\nWhere are the strongest association signals located (do peaks cluster on particular chromosomes)?\nWhy are most points close to the bottom of the plot? What does this tell you about polygenic traits?\nHow does the −log10(P) scale aid interpretation compared to plotting raw P-values?\nWhat biological processes could lead to a few tall peaks versus many low signals (e.g., selection, drift, mutation rate, linkage)?\n\n\n\nYou will usually see a small number of very low P-values; with large −log10 values they sit at the top of the y-axis. For these, there is strong support that they affect the trait.\nYou will also see many SNPs with P-values around 0.1 or greater. These are at the bottom of the y-axis. There is weak support that they affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−log10 scale plotting\n\n\n\nNote that we use plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P)) to plot the Wald_P P-values on a negative log scale. This means that very significant P-values (e.g., P = 1 × 10^−9.5) will show as high points on the plot (e.g., at position 9.5 on the vertical y-axis in this case).\n\n\nAll the non-significant SNPs (e.g., P = 0.1, which is 1 × 10^−1) will be at the bottom of the y-axis. If most variants have small or no effects on traits, there will be many of these.\nThis illustrates polygenic architecture: many variants with small effects and a few with larger effects."

    "text": "2.1 Background\nIn the lectures, we learnt about quantitative traits and how to analyse them. To recap, quantitative traits are often described as complex traits because they are affected by genetic variation in many genes. The genetic variants in those genes each account for a small proportion of the trait variation. We usually assume that they contribute in an additive way (rather than more complex ways).\nOne good way to identify loci controlling quantitative traits is to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWAS experiments use diversity panels of individuals to identify genetic markers that are significantly associated with a trait of interest.\nUsing a diversity panel instead of a biparental mapping population ensures that linkage disequilibrium is low (segments of co-inherited DNA are small), and therefore resolution is high (QTL sizes are small), which helps to narrow down the regions containing the genes controlling the trait. Diversity panels also capture much more genetic variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative traits and evolution\n\n\n\nMost traits are quantitative, and are caused by multiple genetic variants.

    "text": "2.2 Fission yeast\nIn this workshop we will use data from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is a model species for cell biology. You can read more about S. pombe here.\nWhen fission yeast is not being used in labs as a model species for cell biology, it usually grows on fruit. It is most often found in high-sugar fruits or in fermented beverages (wine, beer, and quite often in cachaça in Brazil).\n\n\nFigure 1. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Fission yeast is an excellent model system. It is easy to grow in the laboratory, easy to transform, and it has a very small genome (12 Mb). It has ~5,000 protein-coding genes and ~1,500 non-coding RNAs. It is haploid. Fission yeast and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not closely related fungi, so study of both has contributed greatly to our understanding of molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and quantitative genetics.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 GWAS for yeast\nGWAS is often used for human or crop traits, but we can apply this method to any sexually recombining eukaryotic species for which we have trait data and polymorphism data (e.g., SNPs).\nThe data we will use come from two papers: Nature Genetics and Nature Communications. These articles described the genetic diversity of 160 strains of this species by sequencing their genomes, and measured over 200 traits.\nIn this workshop we will examine GWAS results for four traits and consider what they could mean for the evolution of this species.\n\n\n2.4 The traits\nThe traits we will look at today are:\nGrowth in 400 mM NaCl The growth rate of the strains in 400 mM salt. This could be important if strains grew in fruit near the sea or in salty substrates.\nGrowth at elevated temperature The growth rate of the strains at 40 °C. This is quite warm for this yeast, so it is a stressful condition.\nMaximal cell density in rich medium This trait measures how well each strain grows when given plenty of sugar and other resources.\nGlucose/fructose utilisation in wine How much of the glucose and fructose each strain used in grape must (used to make wine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraits and trade-offs\n\n\n\nA high value in one of these traits could be adaptive in one environment but suboptimal in another. Also, optimising one trait may limit another trait. This could be because one mutation results in multiple changes, or the alleles that influence two traits are closely linked.\n\n\n\n\n3 Exercises\n\n3.1 Exploring the data\nFirst, clear all the previous data you may have in R, set your working directory, and load the GWAS data.\nTo set a working directory you can either use a command (as below), or use the menus;\nSession &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory.\n\n#clear all the previous data\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#set working directory\n#your working directory will be different!\nsetwd(\"/Users/dj757/gd/modules/BIO56I/workshops/gwas\")\n\n#load the data\nload(url(\"http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dj757/BIO00056I/data/gwas-data.Rda\"))\n\nAfter loading these data you will have four data frames called gluc, heat, rich, and salt. Each contains the GWAS results for one trait. Start by looking at salt.\nTry these commands to see what they contain:\n\n#examine what is in the salt data frame\nhead(salt)\nnrow(salt)\nsummary(salt)\nView(salt)\n\nThis table contains the output from a GWAS tool called LDAK. This is one of many software tools that run GWAS analyses. It describes the association of each SNP with the trait of salt tolerance.\nEach row of the table contains information about one SNP. For our purposes, the important columns are:\n\nWald_P, the P-value, the probability that this SNP is associated with this trait\nChr, which chromosome the SNP is on\nBP, the position of the SNP in the chromosome\nEffect_size, how strongly this variant affects the trait\n\nThe effect size of the variant estimates the proportion of trait variation that is explained by this SNP. From our understanding of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, we know that most variants are selectively neutral, i.e., they have little or no effect on fitness.\nGiven this, we might expect that most variants have small, or no, effects on traits.\n\n\n3.2 Manhattan plot\nA Manhattan plot is a standard way of viewing GWAS results. They are named Manhattan plots because they resemble the skyline of a high-rise city, such as Manhattan (New York).\nManhattan plots show the position of the SNP on the x-axis, and the P-value of the association on the y-axis. P-values are plotted as −log10(P), so that very small P-values end up at the top of the plot and stand out.\nThe code below will make a Manhattan plot for the salt trait.\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #make a subset of SNPs from this chromosome\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      #plot these\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\",j),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      #draw a threshold line\n      #SNPs above this line are statistically associated with the trait\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\nYou will usually see a small number of very low P-values; with large −log10 values they sit at the top of the y-axis. For these, there is strong support that they affect the trait.\nYou will also see many SNPs with P-values around 0.1 or greater. These are at the bottom of the y-axis. There is weak support that they affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−log10 scale plotting\n\n\n\nNote that we use plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P)) to plot the Wald_P P-values on a negative log scale. This means that very significant P-values (e.g., P = 1 × 10^−9.5) will show as high points on the plot (e.g., at position 9.5 on the vertical y-axis in this case).\n\n\nAll the non-significant SNPs (e.g., P = 0.1, which is 1 × 10^−1) will be at the bottom of the y-axis. If most variants have small or no effects on traits, there will be many of these.\nThis illustrates polygenic architecture: many variants with small effects and a few with larger effects.\n\n\n3.3 SNP effect sizes\nThe strength of the association between genotype and phenotype relates to the effect size (how strongly the variant affects the trait). Some alleles affect the trait strongly; most do not. Now make a histogram of all the effect sizes.\n\nhist(salt$Effect_size,br=30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this result\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this histogram tell you about SNP effect sizes?\nIs this consistent with the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 How does this influence evolution?\nEffect size here is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by that SNP. Most effect sizes are very small—often &lt; 0.05—meaning each explains far less than 5% of the trait variance.\nConsider how such tiny-effect alleles influence evolutionary change.\nA selective sweep is a process where a beneficial mutation becomes fixed in a population rapidly, removing the genetic variation around the selected allele. Ask yourself:\n\nIf a trait is caused by a small number of large-effect mutations, would you expect to observe a selective sweep?\nWhat about a trait influenced by a large number of mutations with very tiny effects?\nWould you expect to observe a selective sweep if a large-effect mutation lies very close (in strong linkage) to a deleterious allele?\n\n\n\n3.5 Another trait: glucose & fructose use\nIn a vineyard environment, it is advantageous to metabolise glucose and fructose in rotting fruit. Glucose/fructose use is in the gluc data frame.\nAgain, we will look at the P-values (Wald_P) and how much each SNP is predicted to affect the trait (Effect_size).\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      temp = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\", j, \"Gluc\"),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n\n\nAgain, you will see a small number of very low P-values at the top of the y-axis (strong support) and many higher P-values at the bottom (weak or no support; tiny or no effect sizes).\nNow, make a histogram of the effect sizes:\n\nhist(gluc$Effect_size)\n\n\n\n3.6 Looking at two traits\nSpecies cannot adapt to a single condition (e.g., heat or salt) in isolation because environments are complex and variable. As a thought experiment, we will consider this using the fission yeast data.\nWe will compare two Manhattan plots by overlaying them: salt (black) and glucose/fructose metabolism (red). The output PDF will appear in your working directory.\n\n#open the pdf writer\npdf(\"GWAS-plot3.pdf\",width=60)\n#set up the plot layout\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n#loop through chromosomes\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #plot the salt GWAS points (black dots)\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),main = \"\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\")\n      \n      #add the glucose/fructose GWAS points (red crosses)\n      temp2 = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      points(temp2$BP, -log10(temp2$Wald_P),main = \"gluc\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\",col=2,pch=3)\n      \n      #add the significance threshold\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n#close the pdf writer\ndev.off()\n\nNow find the pdf called GWAS-plot3.pdf and take a look.\n\n3.6.1 Might mutations for two traits conflict?\nLook at the significant peak on chromosome 3 (~1,500,000 bp). This likely has a relatively large effect size. There is also an important variant for glucose/fructose use nearby on chromosome 3.\nConsider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex—salty yet fructose-rich (e.g., a coastal vineyard).\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles for both traits are on the same haplotype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaplotypes\n\n\n\nPhysically, a haplotype is a stretch of DNA from one chromosome. In diploids, each individual carries two homologous chromosomes. In haploid S. pombe, different haplotypes are simply different chromosome versions present across the population. Through meiotic recombination haplotypes mix, but SNPs very close together rarely separate, so they tend to travel together.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Haplotype problems\nConsider these situations:\n\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles are on different (opposing) haplotypes?\n\nThe figures below will help to explain.\n Figure 2. Beneficial alleles on one haplotype. Would there be any conflict here?\n\n Figure 3. Beneficial alleles on two different haplotypes. What might happen here? What is the potential problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Summary: what we have learned\nThis workshop used data from fission yeast, but the principles apply broadly to quantitative traits. Key points:\n\nMost SNPs do not strongly associate with traits.\nMost SNPs have very small effects on traits, but some do have detectable effects.\nSNPs do not affect all traits at once. Some SNPs affect one trait; some affect another.\nGenetic variants, like SNPs, travel through time and space in haplotypes.\n\n\n\n5 After the workshop: exam-style questions\nExam questions often ask you to apply workshop principles to other species or scenarios. Reflecting on these helps deepen understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of quantitative genetics\n\n\n\n\nMost SNPs have no effect, or very small effects, on traits.\nSNPs that do affect traits are generally responsible for less than 5% of the trait variation.\nEffect sizes are also small for other genetic variants, such as transposon insertions, duplications/deletions and so on.\nGenetic variants can affect one trait, or several.\nIn the short term, selection occurs on haplotypes, but over time recombination will separate linked variants.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.1 Question 1. Why do most genetic variants have small effects on traits?\nHint: There are two ways to approach this.\n\nConsider what we would expect to happen over time to variants that have large effects. Think first about those with large negative (deleterious) effects, then those that are large and advantageous.\nConsider the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution and basic molecular biology. If you change one amino acid in one protein, how much would you expect this to affect fitness? What about one synonymous mutation?\n\n\n\n5.0.2 Question 2. Imagine a fungicide-resistant fungus is spreading through a country, destroying crops.\nWe know that this fungicide resistance is new, so we hypothesise that a new mutation has occurred. We can culture this fungus in the laboratory and measure its fungicide resistance. How could we use quantitative genetics and population genetics together to find out what is happening?\nHint: Consider how to (i) map trait-associated loci (e.g., GWAS or QTL in controlled crosses) and (ii) test for recent selection or spread (e.g., signatures of selective sweeps, allele-frequency clines, or phylogeography). Also think about linkage and whether resistance arises once or multiple times."

    "text": "3.6 Looking at two traits\nSpecies cannot adapt to a single condition (e.g., heat or salt) in isolation because environments are complex and variable. As a thought experiment, we will consider this using the fission yeast data.\nWe will compare two Manhattan plots by overlaying them: salt (black) and glucose/fructose metabolism (red). The output PDF will appear in your working directory.\n\n#open the pdf writer\npdf(\"GWAS-plot3.pdf\",width=60)\n#set up the plot layout\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n#loop through chromosomes\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #plot the salt GWAS points (black dots)\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),main = \"\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\")\n      \n      #add the glucose/fructose GWAS points (red crosses)\n      temp2 = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      points(temp2$BP, -log10(temp2$Wald_P),main = \"gluc\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\",col=2,pch=3)\n      \n      #add the significance threshold\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n#close the pdf writer\ndev.off()\n\nNow find the pdf called GWAS-plot3.pdf and take a look.\n\n3.6.1 Might mutations for two traits conflict?\nLook at the significant peak on chromosome 3 (~1,500,000 bp). This likely has a relatively large effect size. There is also an important variant for glucose/fructose use nearby on chromosome 3.\nConsider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex—salty yet fructose-rich (e.g., a coastal vineyard).\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles for both traits are on the same haplotype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaplotypes\n\n\n\nPhysically, a haplotype is a stretch of DNA from one chromosome. In diploids, each individual carries two homologous chromosomes. In haploid S. pombe, different haplotypes are simply different chromosome versions present across the population. Through meiotic recombination haplotypes mix, but SNPs very close together rarely separate, so they tend to travel together.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Haplotype problems\nConsider these situations:\n\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles are on different (opposing) haplotypes?\n\nThe figures below will help to explain.\n Figure 2. Beneficial alleles on one haplotype. Would there be any conflict here?\n\n Figure 3. Beneficial alleles on two different haplotypes. What might happen here? What is the potential problem?"

There is disagreement about whether this civilization domesticated goats (if they were goats) or if they merely caught and ate wild goats.\nLuckily, in this scenario, we can occasionally obtain small amounts of DNA from the bones of sheep (or goats) at Çatalhöyük and Aşıklı Höyük. The samples we consider are described below. Note that while this is a hypothetical example, studies of ancient civilizations do use DNA and population genomics.\nFor example, the study of Population genomics of the Viking world used population genomics extensively. Çatalhöyük is older, so in our scenario, we assume the quality and quantity of DNA is much lower."

But it is better to map reads within species, rather than between.\n\n2.2.1 The data\nYou can obtain small amounts of DNA from these ancient sheep/goat samples:\n\n10 samples from Çatalhöyük\n10 samples from Aşıklı Höyük\n\nThere are thousands of genomes of modern goats and available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) from the VarGoats project. This includes the genomes of domesticated goats from Pakistan, Spain & France, the Mediterranean, Northern Europe and most importantly, wild goats from Turkey and Iran.\nThere are also more than 100 ancient genomes from Eurasian domestic and wild sheep samples spanning the past 12,000 years from this article, and 100s of modern sheep genomes available at ENA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou do not need to read these articles, but they show us what population genomic data is available.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 The problem\nThe archaeologists want to know whether Çatalhöyük and Aşıklı Höyük regularly traded sheep and/or goats.\nAn experienced ancient DNA technician has extracted DNA for you from Çatalhöyük and Aşıklı Höyük. There isn’t much, but you can sequence it. You do, and it is disappointing - the sequence reads map to only ten tiny regions in 0.5% of the goat genome and 0.4% of the sheep genome. They don’t have the funds or the samples to obtain any more.\nThe challenge is to explain what this might mean if the SNPs show the samples are more like sheep, more like goats, or in between, and if they traded sheep and goats with each other, or merely caught wild sheep and goats."

Explain how you could use the 10 samples from Çatalhöyük and the 10 samples from Aşíklí Höyük to determine if the people of Çatalhöyük and Aşíklí traded sheep and/or goats (3 marks). Hint: Trading would appear like migration of goats.\nQuestion 3. There is a proposal that the people of Çatalhöyük and Aşıklí domesticated goats, and this domestic breed gave rise to modern domestic breeds in Pakistan and the Mediterranean. Explain how you could use population genomics data to test this proposal.

Students have been struggling with some of the material, so it’s important that we provide questions that are similar enough to the exam questions.\nDan, as agreed your last workshop (week 8) is not in a computer room. You can still use any figures etc that the students would have produced themselves, but please rework the workshop to use this material for more exam style questions. It could include questions about the other two weeks.\nMore on workshops. We still can’t schedule the release of model answers. So please post these manually as soon as possible after a session (and remove them before the material gets released).\nThe discussion board is anonymous, so we will continue using this. The notifications are a bit erratic, so please check regularly.\nVideo captions. Just a reminder, these should be edited and available. Please also add a transcript txt file to the VLE.

That way students will always have access to the correct documents, no matter what happens to any of us. Students have viewing access to the weekly folders on the drive but not the drive itself.\nPlease make sure that there are enough exam style questions in the workshops. Students have been struggling with some of the material, so it’s important that we provide questions that are similar enough to the exam questions.\nDan, as agreed your last workshop (week 8) is not in a computer room. You can still use any figures etc that the students would have produced themselves, but please rework the workshop to use this material for more exam style questions. It could include questions about the other two weeks.\nMore on workshops. We still can’t schedule the release of model answers. So please post these manually as soon as possible after a session (and remove them before the material gets released).\nThe discussion board is anonymous, so we will continue using this. The notifications are a bit erratic, so please check regularly.\nVideo captions. Just a reminder, these should be edited and available. Please also add a transcript txt file to the VLE. If you are rerecording anything: Gareth has a great guide on producing captions using whisper. It works well but if you edit the video before producing the captions it does not handle cuts well, so please check."

The rate of change differs between very different species and between genes.\nRates of change between species differ because:\n\nsmall organisms (like viruses and bacteria) have short generation times\nsmall organisms have high mutation rates\n\nRates of change between genes within a genome differ because the amount of purifying selection acting on a gene differs.\nYou can refresh your knowledge of Phylogenetic trees and the molecular clock from these two recordings:\n\nPhylogenies and molecular clock Part 1\nPhylogenies and molecular clock Part 2"

For example, the global pandemic of the coronavirus SARS-Cov2 (which causes COVID-19 disease) is an RNA virus. As with all viruses, SARS-Cov2 is constantly undergoing evolutionary change.\nThe initial outbreak of the SARS-Cov2 virus in Wuhan China, was dated with amazing accuracy (to the month) to August 2019 using a time tree. Being able to tell when outbreaks occur, as well as where, can be a very powerful tool as it can supplement what we can see from epidemiology.

Then, we would sequence the PCR products from any positive samples and align the sequences (2 marks). This time, we can add the sequences we obtained from the patients (1 mark). If we find that the sequences from patients match those from the local sand flies, we have found the vector (2 marks). If not, we may need to test other potential vectors or consider that there may not be an insect vector involved (1 marks)."

We download the sequences of all the protein-coding genes of each of these species, from the databse TriTrypDB. We then found clusters of orthologous groups (ie: groups of orthologs), using the OrthoFinder software. OrthoFinder identifies the clusters of orthologous groups. The plot above does not show when a species has multiple copies of a gene in an orthologous group (paralogs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthologs, paralogs and orthologous groups\n\n\n\nTwo genes are orthologs if they are in different species and have evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation. Orthologous genes often retain the same function in the course of evolution.\nParalogs are like orthologs, in that they have evolved from a common ancestral gene, but they are in the same species and have arisen by gene duplication.\nOrthologous groups are groups of genes from different species that are all orthologous to each other. An orthologous group may contain one gene from each species, or it may contain multiple genes from some species (paralogs).\n\n\nWe can compare the cladogram of the Trypanosomatid species to Figure 2 (below), which is a phylogenetic tree drawn using the single nucleotide differences in ~1000 single copy genes (genes that every species has exactly one of). This phylogenetic tree will be very reliable, as it is created from tens of thousands of single nucleotide differences.\nYou will recall that we examined a phylogenetic tree of influenza viruses in workshop 5. The influenza virus phylogenetic tree spanned only a few years, whereas this Trypanosomatid tree spans millions of years.\nBut remember that within-population process (especially genetic drift and natural selection) give rise to the differences between species regardless of timescale. A big difference is that we expect many more differences to have accumulated over millions of years than over a few years.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. A phylogenetic tree of the same Trypanosomatid species, drawn using single nucleotide differences in ~1000 single copy genes. This tree has the same species as the gene presence/absence heatmap (Figure 1). Species names are written slightly differently, because Figure 1 indicates the name of the strain used."

In this workshop, we’ll use genome data to investigate these questions.\nIn Figure 1 below, each box represents a population that contains many individuals. Red and blue boxes represent two species.

Leishmania are single-celled protozoan parasites that infect mammals, including people. They have two copies of each chromosome (diploid) and reproduce sexually (they undergo meiosis).\nWe’ll focus on Leishmania guyanensis and closely related species found in South America. Together they form a species complex called Viannia—closely related species that can sometimes interbreed where their ranges overlap.\nThese parasites cause cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a skin disease that leads to long-lasting sores. CL is zoonotic, meaning it mostly circulates in wild animals; humans are infected but probably play a small role in maintaining the parasite population.\nBecause Viannia parasites infect many native mammals in South America, they are probably deeply embedded in the region’s ecology.\n\n2.2.1 Leishmania are spread by sand flies\nThree facts about sand flies are important for today:\n\nSand flies are mainly found in forests or forest edges (not in sand on the beach).\nThey are not strong flyers, so they don’t carry Leishmania parasites very long distances.\nThe different sand fly species, and even populations within species, have their own ecological niches and characteristics.\n\nFor example, certain populations of sand flies carry some species of Leishmania, but not others."

The analysis is being carried out at the University of York, working with colleagues in Manaus, Brazil—a large city on the Amazon River surrounded by the Amazon Rainforest. Because the Amazon is so biodiverse, several Viannia species may be present there.\nParasites were isolated from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and grown in the lab to extract DNA. We then sequenced the DNA from 70+ parasites using short-read (Illumina) sequencing.\nFrom these genomes, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—tiny differences at single DNA letters. To add context, we also included public data for related Viannia species from the European Nucleotide Archive. A short summary of the computational steps is at the end of this document.\nFor this workshop, all you need to know is that we have SNP data from:\n\n71 Leishmania strains collected in Manaus (most likely to be L. guyanensis)\n21 L. braziliensis strains from various locations in Brazil\n25 L. panamensis strains from Panama\n34 L. peruviana strains from Peru\none L. shawi strain from Brazil\n\nWe’ll use these data to explore species, populations, and mixing (hybridization) within the Viannia group."

    "text": "3.1 Exploring the data\nIn this workshop we will explore the results we generated. We will look at three ways to visualise population structure.\n\n3.1.1 Population genomic data files\nWhile genomes contain many types of polymorphisms, population genomic analysis often uses only single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. This is because SNPs are very abundant and have properties that make them easier to model mathematically.\nSNPs and other polymorphisms are affected by many processes, such as genetic drift, migration, selection and recombination. However, SNP data can be represented relatively simply as a table.\nThe standard format for representing SNP data is called VCF (Variant Call Format). Here is a small example of what a VCF file looks like.\n#CHROM  POS REF ALT Lg1 Lg2 Lg3 Lg4\n01  2177    A   G   0/1 1/1 1/1 0/1\n01  2636    G   A   0/0 0/1 0/1 0/0\n01  9844    G   A   0/1 0/0 0/0 0/0\n...\n35  9999    G   A   1/1 0/0 0/1 0/0\nIt is almost like a table that we could load into Excel, where each row indicates a position in the genome, and columns contain information about that position.\nIt has a header line:\n#CHROM POS REF ALT\nThis indicates that the first column is the chromosome number (#CHROM), the second column is the position on that chromosome (POS), the third column is the reference allele (REF), and the fourth column is the alternative allele (ALT).\nAfter this, we have the genotypes for each sample. In this example, there are four samples:\nLg1 Lg2 Lg3 Lg4\nAfter this, we have the genotypes for the strains that are in the VCF (four in this case). They are coded as 0 for the reference allele (A) and 1 for the alternative allele (G). So for an A/G polymorphism:\n\nAA is coded as 0/0\nAG is coded as 0/1\nGG is coded as 1/1\n\nThe population genomics community has developed many software tools that process these data to extract information (no tool does it all). In this workshop we will look at a phylogenetic tree, principal components analysis (PCA), and a STRUCTURE plot. These are all used to describe population structure and detect hybrids between populations or between species."

    "text": "3.2 The phylogeny\nA phylogenetic tree is a good first look at how similar or different many samples are. But when individuals mix between populations or species (hybridisation), a simple branching tree can be misleading.\nThink of a tree of people grouped by ancestry. Where would you place someone with one parent from Spain and one from Fiji? They don’t fit neatly on a single branch with the Spanish and the Fijians. The same display issue can happen in nature when populations interbreed.\nTo handle this, we used a network approach (a splits network made with the software SplitsTree) that can show conflicting signals in the data—like those caused by mixing between populations or species.\nBelow is our SplitsTree network. There are many samples, so coloured dots cluster tightly. The Manaus samples are dark blue. Most cluster near Leishmania guyanensis at the top. We marked the Manaus samples that do not with arrows.\n Figure 2: A SplitsTree phylogeny. The overall phylogeny is in the centre, and we zoom in to various clades (groups of related samples) around the edges. Each dot is a sample, coloured by species. The dark blue dots are samples we collected from Manaus, Brazil.\n\n3.2.1 Interpreting the phylogeny\nNow spend some time discussing the SplitsTree phylogeny, using the discussion points below as a guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: phylogeny\n\n\n\n\nFrom this figure, do the Viannia species look clearly separated, or do some overlap?\nA few Manaus samples don’t cluster with L. guyanensis. What could explain that?\nWhat might this suggest about the causes of CL in the Amazon (e.g., multiple species, local ecology, host/vector differences)?\nLook at the L. peruviana–L. braziliensis area (red box). One strain sits between the two. What could that indicate?\nExamine the data from the single L. shawi sample (light blue). Does its branch look unusually long? Remember: longer branches usually mean more mutations (this is not a dated tree, just a measure of genetic differences)."

    "section": "3.3 Principal components clustering",
    "text": "3.3 Principal components clustering\nPopulation structure is an important facet of most (if not all) species. Populations sometimes split into species, and all natural selection begins within a population. So when we start to examine the genetic diversity of a species, it is wise to look at population structure.\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) is a useful tool for understanding population structure. PCA reduces the variables in our data set (thousands of SNPs in rows, and many individuals in columns), while preserving a lot of the information about population structure.\nA simple way to interpret PCA data is to consider that the distance between two individuals on a two-dimensional PCA plot represents the genetic distance between those samples. So, if they are close on the plot, they are close genetically. If they are distant on the plot, they are distant genetically. We would expect individuals from within a population or species to fall close to each other on a PCA plot.\nFirst look at Figure 3 below. This shows PCA clustering of all the other Viannia species, apart from the samples we collected from Manaus. Discuss with the people at your table:\n\nDo the species cluster genetically?\nDo L. peruviana and L. braziliensis really look like two different species?\n\nNote: The blue dashed lines are a guide to the eye to help you see the clusters.\n Figure 3. PCA clustering of Viannia species from throughout South America.\nNow look at Figure 4, which shows PCA clustering of Viannia species from throughout South America (on the left), and those that were collected from Manaus (on the right). Note that the PC axes are on the same scale here.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. PCA clustering of all the Leishmania samples from thoughout South America (left), and those that were collected from Manaus (right)\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Interpreting principal component plots\nUse the discussion points below to discuss the PCA plots with the people at your table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA (species)\n\n\n\n\nDoes it look like the samples that came from Manaus are all the same species?\nSince the positions on the PCA plot separate the species, does this help to identify the species from Manaus?\nWhat does this tell you about the causes of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Amazon region?\nSince Leishmania are single-celled organisms and they all cause a similar disease, population genomics is the only way to identify which sample belongs to which species. Why would we not merely use PCR to identify the species?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Principal components clustering 2: geography and genetics\nWe can look at the PC plots another way, simply by colouring the samples according to where they came from (geography).\nBecause sand flies that carry Leishmania do not fly very far, it is possible that geographic distance is the main factor that determines the genetic distance between Leishmania populations. This concept is called isolation by distance.\nThe Leishmania parasites we have genome data for come from Brazil, Peru and Panama, which are very far apart, so we might expect to see isolation by distance in the PCA plot.\nNote that in Figure 5 below: - the colour of each point indicates the location where the sample was collected - the position on the PCA plot indicates how closely related each sample is. If two strains sit close together on the plot, they are closely related genetically.\n\n\nFigure 5. PCA clustering of Viannia species from throughout South America. The blue dashed lines are not important here, but will help with interpretation of Figure 6 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA and isolation by distance\n\n\n\nNote that samples from the same country are plotted in the same colour, and samples that are genetically similar will fall close together on the plot.\n\nDo you see any examples of genetically similar samples that are all from the same country? These will represent one local population of the same species. This is what we expect from a local population that is one species.\nDo you see any examples of the opposite: genetically similar samples that are close together on the PCA plot, with different colours showing that they are from different countries?\nHow can we interpret the finding that there are genetically similar individuals living in different countries? It might help to think about this with respect to human populations.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. PCA clustering of only the Leishmania strains we collected from Manaus. The PCA axes are the same as Figure 5 above. The blue dashed lines will help with interpretation compared to Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA and species in Manaus\n\n\n\n\nSince samples that are genetically similar will fall close together on the plot, does it look like all the samples from Manaus are the same species?\nWhat does this tell us about the causes of genetic differentiation between species?\nIn other words, why are all these Leishmania samples from Manaus not interbreeding and becoming more genetically similar?\nCan you guess what species are present in Manaus, based on the coordinates of species in previous PCA plots?\nIs the idea that there are different Leishmania species in Manaus that we obtain from the PCA plots consistent with the phylogeny we looked at earlier?"

We’ll call these STRUCTURE plots for now.\nSTRUCTURE plots show the proportion of ancestry from different populations (or species) for each individual in the data set. Usually, each column of a STRUCTURE plot represents one individual, and the different colours within each column represent the proportion of ancestry from different populations (or species).\nSTRUCTURE plots are usually used to describe population structure within a species, but they can also be used to describe structure between closely related species, as we do here.\nOur STRUCTURE plot is below. Samples from Manaus are marked in the open rectangle at the bottom of the plot. Again, most look like L. guyanensis, and those that do not are marked with arrows, as we did in the phylogeny.\n\nFigure 7. A STRUCTURE plot showing the Leishmania species we studied. Samples that were obtained from Manaus are marked in the open rectangle at the bottom of the plot. Most appear to be Leishmania guyanensis, but a few do not, and these are marked with arrows as we did in Figure 2, the SplitsTree phylogeny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: the STRUCTURE plot\n\n\n\n\nEach column is a different strain, and the colours represent the proportion of this strain’s ancestry that is derived from each species. If there are hybrids between species, we would expect to see columns with multiple colours.\nThe most obvious thing about this plot is that the species are different colours.\nDoes this visualisation of the data suggest that there is extensive breeding between species in the Viannia group?\nConsider the Leishmania parasites circulating around Manaus (see Figure 6). Do they all look like one species, or are there multiple species present?\nLook at the one strain of Leishmania shawi. This looks like a hybrid between two species.\nGo back to Figure 2 (the phylogeny) and the PCA plots to examine where the Leishmania shawi sample is placed. Does its placement in those plots make sense, given what we see in the STRUCTURE plot?"

    "text": "5.1 Question 1 (10 points)\nA plant pathogenic virus has been spreading across farms in the United Kingdom. You have collected viral DNA sequences from infected plants at different locations over the past 10 years.\n\nDefine what the molecular clock hypothesis is. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe molecular clock hypothesis is that th erate of accumulation of mutatinos in a population is approximately constant over time. This means that the number of mutations that accumulate in a lineage is proportional to the time since the common ancestor of samples.\n\n\n\nYou create a phylogenetic tree from your viral sequences. On this tree, sequences from 2015 are near the root, and sequences from 2025 are at the tips. Explain what the branch lengths on this tree represent. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe branch lengths of phylogenetic trees represent the number of mutations that have occurred between lineages. Due to the molecular clock these lengths are proportional to the time that has elapsed since the common ancestor of samples. In this case, the branch lengths represent the time since the strain(s) in question diverged from each other.\n\n\n\nYou plot genetic distance against time (in years) between virus samples and observe a positive linear relationship. State which evolutionary process causes mutations to accumulate over time. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe evolutionary processes that cause mutations to accumulate over time are:\n\nMutations, which arise mainly from DNA replication errors.\nGenetic drift, which causes mutations to become fixed in a population over time.\nNB: Natural selection, also filters mutations, by removing deleterious mutations, and increasing the frequency of beneficial mutations, but this is not the main cause of the clock-like accumulation of mutations over time.\nNB: Migration is another source of mutations, but the original source of new mutations from a migration is mutation in some other population.\n\n\n\n\nSuggest ONE piece of information that phylogenetic analysis could provide to help farmers control the spread of this virus. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible answers include:\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying when the virus first arrived in the UK. To determine this we would obtain the date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the UK samples (the root of the tree).\nIdentifying the source of the virus. To determine this we would need to include samples from other countries in the phylogenetic analysis, and see which country’s samples are most closely related to the UK samples.\nIdentifying whether transmission was local or long-distance. To determine this we would need to include location metadata for each sample, and see whether closely related samples are from nearby locations (local transmission) or from distant locations (long-distance transmission).\n\n\n\n\nTo make your analysis more reliable, identify TWO pieces of metadata you would need to collect along with each viral sequence sample. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nDate of sample collection: This is essential for calibrating the molecular clock and estimating the rate of mutation accumulation over time.\nThe location of sample collection: This helps to understand the geographic spread and transmission patterns of the virus.\nWe could also collect information about movement of plants, seed and spoil into and out of each field. This might identify causal factors."

    "text": "5.2 Question 2 (10 points)\nThis practical examined molecular evolution in the influenza virus using phylogenetic methods.\n\nRNA viruses like influenza are particularly good for studying the molecular clock over short time periods. Give TWO reasons why RNA viruses accumulate mutations rapidly. (4 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nRNA viruses have high mutation rates because their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases lack proofreading ability, leading to more replication errors.\nRNA viruses often have short generation times, allowing for many replication cycles in a short period\n\n\n\n\nIn the Wellington influenza data, you found that genetic distance increased with time between sample groups. Describe the pattern you observed in the plot and state whether this supports the molecular clock hypothesis. (3 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nYes, the plot showed a positive linear relationship between genetic distance and time between sample groups. This means that as the time between samples increased, the genetic distance also increased. This pattern supports the molecular clock hypothesis, which predicts that mutations accumulate at a roughly constant rate over time.\n\n\n\nDefine what purifying selection is. (1 point)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nPurifying selection is the loss of deleterious mutations from populations.\n\n\n\nA gene under strong purifying selection will have fewer mutations accumulate over time compared to a gene under weak purifying selection. Explain why this occurs. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nPopulation genetic processes within species give rise to divergence between species. Since purifying selection that acts to preserve functional DNA sequences by removing harmful mutations that negatively affect an organism’s fitness, genes under strong purifying selection will accumulate fewer mutations accumulate over time."

The rate of change differs between very different species and between genes.\nRates of change between species differ because:\n\nsmall organisms (like viruses and bacteria) have short generation times\nsmall organisms have high mutation rates\n\nRates of change between genes within a genome differ because the amount of purifying selection acting on a gene differs.\nYou can refresh your knowledge of Phylogenetic trees and the molecular clock from these two recordings:\n\nPhylogenies and molecular clock Part 1\nPhylogenies and molecular clock Part 2"

For example, the global pandemic of the coronavirus SARS-Cov2 (which causes COVID-19 disease) is an RNA virus.

    "text": "5.1 Question 1 (10 points)\nA plant pathogenic virus has been spreading across farms in the United Kingdom. You have collected viral DNA sequences from infected plants at different locations over the past 10 years.\n\nDefine what the molecular clock hypothesis is. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe molecular clock hypothesis is that th erate of accumulation of mutatinos in a population is approximately constant over time. This means that the number of mutations that accumulate in a lineage is proportional to the time since the common ancestor of samples.\n\n\n\nYou create a phylogenetic tree from your viral sequences. On this tree, sequences from 2015 are near the root, and sequences from 2025 are at the tips. Explain what the branch lengths on this tree represent. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe branch lengths of phylogenetic trees represent the number of mutations that have occurred between lineages. Due to the molecular clock these lengths are proportional to the time that has elapsed since the common ancestor of samples. In this case, the branch lengths represent the time since the strain(s) in question diverged from each other.\n\n\n\nYou plot genetic distance against time (in years) between virus samples and observe a positive linear relationship. State which evolutionary process causes mutations to accumulate over time. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe evolutionary processes that cause mutations to accumulate over time are:\n\nMutations, which arise mainly from DNA replication errors.\nGenetic drift, which causes mutations to become fixed in a population over time.\nNB: Natural selection, also filters mutations, by removing deleterious mutations, and increasing the frequency of beneficial mutations, but this is not the main cause of the clock-like accumulation of mutations over time.\nNB: Migration is another source of mutations, but the original source of new mutations from a migration is mutation in some other population.\n\n\n\n\nSuggest ONE piece of information that phylogenetic analysis could provide to help farmers control the spread of this virus. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible answers include:\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying when the virus first arrived in the UK. To determine this we would obtain the date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the UK samples (the root of the tree).\nIdentifying the source of the virus. To determine this we would need to include samples from other countries in the phylogenetic analysis, and see which country’s samples are most closely related to the UK samples.\nIdentifying whether transmission was local or long-distance. To determine this we would need to include location metadata for each sample, and see whether closely related samples are from nearby locations (local transmission) or from distant locations (long-distance transmission).\n\n\n\n\nTo make your analysis more reliable, identify TWO pieces of metadata you would need to collect along with each viral sequence sample. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nDate of sample collection: This is essential for calibrating the molecular clock and estimating the rate of mutation accumulation over time.\nThe location of sample collection: This helps to understand the geographic spread and transmission patterns of the virus.\nWe could also collect information about movement of plants, seed and spoil into and out of each field. This might identify causal factors."

Give TWO reasons why RNA viruses accumulate mutations rapidly. (4 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nRNA viruses have high mutation rates because their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases lack proofreading ability, leading to more replication errors.\nRNA viruses often have short generation times, allowing for many replication cycles in a short period\n\n\n\n\nIn the Wellington influenza data, you found that genetic distance increased with time between sample groups. Describe the pattern you observed in the plot and state whether this supports the molecular clock hypothesis. (3 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nYes, the plot showed a positive linear relationship between genetic distance and time between sample groups. This means that as the time between samples increased, the genetic distance also increased. This pattern supports the molecular clock hypothesis, which predicts that mutations accumulate at a roughly constant rate over time.\n\n\n\nDefine what purifying selection is. (1 point)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nPurifying selection is the loss of deleterious mutations from populations.\n\n\n\nA gene under strong purifying selection will have fewer mutations accumulate over time compared to a gene under weak purifying selection. Explain why this occurs. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nPopulation genetic processes within species give rise to divergence between species. Since purifying selection that acts to preserve functional DNA sequences by removing harmful mutations that negatively affect an organism’s fitness, genes under strong purifying selection will accumulate fewer mutations accumulate over time."

Plasmodium falciparum is a single celled eukaryotic parasite that causes malaria. P. falciparum infections are restricted to humans and the parasite is transmitted from person to person by mosquitos. The life cycle involved sexual recombination, with the haploid male and female forms developing within the human host which form diploid zygotes in the mosquito. Malaraia infections are treated with drugs, but mutations occur in thsi parasite that result in drug resistance occur from time to time.\nMore than 20,000 P. falciparum genomes have been sequenced. The parasites were collected from Africa, South America, South East Asia and Oceania (countries in the Pacific ocean). The majority were collected between the years 2000 and 2020. From these genomes, 3 million SNPs were identified, enabling many different population genetic analyses.\n\nGiven your knowledge about population genomics, explain why collecting and sequencing the genomes of 20,000 P. falciparum strains is useful for malaria control and elimination? In your answer, describe some questions about P. falciparum biology that we could not answer from just one single P. falciparum genome, but could answer from the large population genomics data set we have now. (10 marks, 10 lines)\n\nModel Answer: Population structure: are P. falciparum parasites divided into populations that are genetically different? (2). Genome scale genetic diversity: Are different populations more or less diverse? (2). Gene diversity studies, selection and cell biology: Which genes have higher or lower genetic diversity? (1). Can we identify genes that appear to be subject to balancing selection, strong purifying selection, or selective sweeps (2-3). Migration analyses: Where are parasites migrating to/from?

    "text": "2.1 Background\nIn the lectures, we learnt about quantitative traits and how to analyse them. To recap, quantitative traits are often described as complex traits because they are affected by genetic variation in many genes. The genetic variants in those genes each account for a small proportion of the trait variation. We usually assume that they contribute in an additive way (rather than more complex ways).\nOne good way to identify loci controlling quantitative traits is to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWAS experiments use diversity panels of individuals to identify genetic markers that are significantly associated with a trait of interest.\nUsing a diversity panel instead of a biparental mapping population ensures that linkage disequilibrium is low (segments of co-inherited DNA are small), and therefore resolution is high (QTL sizes are small), which helps to narrow down the regions containing the genes controlling the trait. Diversity panels also capture much more genetic variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative traits and evolution\n\n\n\nMost traits are quantitative, and are caused by multiple genetic variants.

    "text": "2.2 Fission yeast\nIn this workshop we will use data from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is a model species for cell biology. You can read more about S. pombe here.\nWhen fission yeast is not being used in labs as a model species for cell biology, it usually grows on fruit. It is most often found in high-sugar fruits or in fermented beverages (wine, beer, and quite often in cachaça in Brazil).\n\n\nFigure 1. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Fission yeast is an excellent model system. It is easy to grow in the laboratory, easy to transform, and it has a very small genome (12 Mb). It has ~5,000 protein-coding genes and ~1,500 non-coding RNAs. It is haploid. Fission yeast and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not closely related fungi, so study of both has contributed greatly to our understanding of molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and quantitative genetics.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 GWAS for yeast\nGWAS is often used for human or crop traits, but we can apply this method to any sexually recombining eukaryotic species for which we have trait data and polymorphism data (e.g., SNPs).\nThe data we will use come from two papers: Nature Genetics and Nature Communications. These articles described the genetic diversity of 160 strains of this species by sequencing their genomes, and measured over 200 traits.\nIn this workshop we will examine GWAS results for four traits and consider what they could mean for the evolution of this species.\n\n\n2.4 The traits\nThe traits we will look at today are:\nGrowth in 400 mM NaCl The growth rate of the strains in 400 mM salt. This could be important if strains grew in fruit near the sea or in salty substrates.\nGrowth at elevated temperature The growth rate of the strains at 40 °C. This is quite warm for this yeast, so it is a stressful condition.\nMaximal cell density in rich medium This trait measures how well each strain grows when given plenty of sugar and other resources.\nGlucose/fructose utilisation in wine How much of the glucose and fructose each strain used in grape must (used to make wine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraits and trade-offs\n\n\n\nA high value in one of these traits could be adaptive in one environment but suboptimal in another. Also, optimising one trait may limit another trait. This could be because one mutation results in multiple changes, or the alleles that influence two traits are closely linked.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Exercises\n\n3.1 Exploring the data\nFirst, clear all the previous data you may have in R, set your working directory, and load the GWAS data.\nTo set a working directory you can either use a command (as below), or use the menus;\nSession &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory.\n\n#clear all the previous data\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#set working directory\n#your working directory will be different!\nsetwd(\"/Users/dj757/gd/modules/BIO56I/workshops/gwas\")\n\n#load the data\nload(url(\"http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dj757/BIO00056I/data/gwas-data.Rda\"))\n\nAfter loading these data you will have four data frames called gluc, heat, rich, and salt. Each contains the GWAS results for one trait. Start by looking at salt.\nTry these commands to see what they contain:\n\n#examine what is in the salt data frame\nhead(salt)\nnrow(salt)\nsummary(salt)\nView(salt)\n\nThis table contains the output from a GWAS tool called LDAK. This is one of many software tools that run GWAS analyses. It describes the association of each SNP with the trait of salt tolerance.\nEach row of the table contains information about one SNP. For our purposes, the important columns are:\n\nWald_P, the P-value, the probability that this SNP is associated with this trait\nChr, which chromosome the SNP is on\nBP, the position of the SNP in the chromosome\nEffect_size, how strongly this variant affects the trait\n\nThe effect size of the variant estimates the proportion of trait variation that is explained by this SNP. From our understanding of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, we know that most variants are selectively neutral, i.e., they have little or no effect on fitness.\nGiven this, we might expect that most variants have small, or no, effects on traits.\n\n\n\n3.2 Manhattan plot\nA Manhattan plot is a standard way of viewing GWAS results. They are named Manhattan plots because they resemble the skyline of a high-rise city, such as Manhattan (New York).\nManhattan plots show the position of the SNP on the x-axis, and the P-value of the association on the y-axis. P-values are plotted as −log10(P), so that very small P-values end up at the top of the plot and stand out.\nThe code below will make a Manhattan plot for the salt trait.\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #make a subset of SNPs from this chromosome\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      #plot these\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\",j),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      #draw a threshold line\n      #SNPs above this line are statistically associated with the trait\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: Manhattan plot\n\n\n\n\nWhere are the strongest association signals located (do peaks cluster on particular chromosomes)?\nWhy are most points close to the bottom of the plot? What does this tell you about polygenic traits?\nHow does the −log10(P) scale aid interpretation compared to plotting raw P-values?\nWhat biological processes could lead to a few tall peaks versus many low signals (e.g., selection, drift, mutation rate, linkage)?\n\n\n\nYou will usually see a small number of very low P-values; with large −log10 values they sit at the top of the y-axis. For these, there is strong support that they affect the trait.\nYou will also see many SNPs with P-values around 0.1 or greater. These are at the bottom of the y-axis. There is weak support that they affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−log10 scale plotting\n\n\n\nNote that we use plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P)) to plot the Wald_P P-values on a negative log scale. This means that very significant P-values (e.g., P = 1 × 10^−9.5) will show as high points on the plot (e.g., at position 9.5 on the vertical y-axis in this case).\n\n\nAll the non-significant SNPs (e.g., P = 0.1, which is 1 × 10^−1) will be at the bottom of the y-axis. If most variants have small or no effects on traits, there will be many of these.\nThis illustrates polygenic architecture: many variants with small effects and a few with larger effects.\n\n\n3.3 SNP effect sizes\nThe strength of the association between genotype and phenotype relates to the effect size (how strongly the variant affects the trait). Some alleles affect the trait strongly; most do not. Now make a histogram of all the effect sizes.\n\nhist(salt$Effect_size,br=30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: effect sizes\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the histogram shape tell you about the distribution of SNP effect sizes?\nHow does this pattern relate to the Neutral Theory (many neutral or near-neutral variants)?\nWhere would you expect to see evidence of purifying selection or positive selection in such a distribution?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 How does this influence evolution?\nEffect size here is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by that SNP. Most effect sizes are very small—often &lt; 0.05—meaning each explains far less than 5% of the trait variance.\nConsider how such tiny-effect alleles influence evolutionary change.\nA selective sweep is a process where a beneficial mutation becomes fixed in a population rapidly, removing the genetic variation around the selected allele.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: selective sweeps and polygenicity\n\n\n\n\nIf a trait is influenced by a few large-effect mutations, how likely is a classic selective sweep and why?\nIf a trait is influenced by many tiny-effect mutations, what evolutionary pattern replaces a sweep? (Think subtle allele frequency shifts.)\nHow can tight linkage to a deleterious allele modify or slow a sweep?\nWhat genomic signatures (e.g., reduced diversity, extended haplotype homozygosity) would differ between oligogenic and highly polygenic adaptation?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Another trait: glucose & fructose use\nIn a vineyard environment, it is advantageous to metabolise glucose and fructose in rotting fruit. Glucose/fructose use is in the gluc data frame.\nAgain, we will look at the P-values (Wald_P) and how much each SNP is predicted to affect the trait (Effect_size).\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      temp = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\", j, \"Gluc\"),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n::: callout-tip\n# Discussion points: second trait comparison\n\n- Do the strongest glucose/fructose association peaks overlap with salt peaks? What could shared loci imply (pleiotropy vs linkage)?\n- Are there trait-specific peaks? What might that say about specialised metabolic pathways?\n- How could environmental context (salinity vs sugar availability) shift which alleles are favoured?\n:::\n\nAgain, you will see a small number of very low P-values at the top of the y-axis (strong support) and many higher P-values at the bottom (weak or no support; tiny or no effect sizes).\n\nNow, make a histogram of the effect sizes:\n\n\nhist(gluc$Effect_size)\n\n\n\n3.6 Looking at two traits\nSpecies cannot adapt to a single condition (e.g., heat or salt) in isolation because environments are complex and variable. As a thought experiment, we will consider this using the fission yeast data.\nWe will compare two Manhattan plots by overlaying them: salt (black) and glucose/fructose metabolism (red). The output PDF will appear in your working directory.\n\n#open the pdf writer\npdf(\"GWAS-plot3.pdf\",width=60)\n#set up the plot layout\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n#loop through chromosomes\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #plot the salt GWAS points (black dots)\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),main = \"\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\")\n      \n      #add the glucose/fructose GWAS points (red crosses)\n      temp2 = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      points(temp2$BP, -log10(temp2$Wald_P),main = \"gluc\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\",col=2,pch=3)\n      \n      #add the significance threshold\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n#close the pdf writer\ndev.off()\n\nNow find the pdf called GWAS-plot3.pdf and take a look.\n\n3.6.1 Might mutations for two traits conflict?\nLook at the significant peak on chromosome 3 (~1,500,000 bp). This likely has a relatively large effect size. There is also an important variant for glucose/fructose use nearby on chromosome 3.\nConsider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex—salty yet fructose-rich (e.g., a coastal vineyard).\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles for both traits are on the same haplotype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaplotypes\n\n\n\nPhysically, a haplotype is a stretch of DNA from one chromosome. In diploids, each individual carries two homologous chromosomes. In haploid S. pombe, different haplotypes are simply different chromosome versions present across the population. Through meiotic recombination haplotypes mix, but SNPs very close together rarely separate, so they tend to travel together.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Haplotype problems\nConsider these situations:\n\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\nWhat might happen if helpful alleles are on different (opposing) haplotypes?\n\nThe figures below will help to explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: haplotypes and linkage\n\n\n\n\nHow does tight linkage between beneficial alleles influence the speed of joint adaptation?\nWhat evolutionary constraint arises when beneficial alleles are on different haplotypes in low recombination regions?\nHow can recombination rate modulate the resolution of this “conflict” between opposing haplotypes?\nWhich scenario (single vs opposing haplotypes) better facilitates rapid multi-trait optimisation?\n\n\n\n Figure 2. Beneficial alleles on one haplotype. Would there be any conflict here?\n\n Figure 3. Beneficial alleles on two different haplotypes. What might happen here? What is the potential problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Summary: what we have learned\nThis workshop used data from fission yeast, but the principles apply broadly to quantitative traits. Key points:\n\nMost SNPs do not strongly associate with traits.\nMost SNPs have very small effects on traits, but some do have detectable effects.\nSNPs do not affect all traits at once. Some SNPs affect one trait; some affect another.\nGenetic variants, like SNPs, travel through time and space in haplotypes.\n\n\n\n\n5 After the workshop: exam-style questions\nExam questions often ask you to apply workshop principles to other species or scenarios. Reflecting on these helps deepen understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of quantitative genetics\n\n\n\n\nMost SNPs have no effect, or very small effects, on traits.\nSNPs that do affect traits are generally responsible for less than 5% of the trait variation.\nEffect sizes are also small for other genetic variants, such as transposon insertions, duplications/deletions and so on.\nGenetic variants can affect one trait, or several.\nIn the short term, selection occurs on haplotypes, but over time recombination will separate linked variants.\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Question 1 (10 points)\nThis question checks your understanding of quantitative traits and why most variants have small effects.\n\nDefine the difference between a simple (single-gene) trait and a quantitative trait. Give one example of each from this workshop. (2 points)\nThe histogram of SNP effect sizes for the salt trait is heavily skewed towards zero. Describe what this pattern tells us about the distribution of SNP effects in the population. (3 points)\nUsing the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, explain why most SNPs are expected to have little or no effect on fitness. (3 points)\nSuggest one practical way to increase the power of a GWAS to detect very small-effect variants and explain why it helps. (2 points)\n\n\n\n5.2 Question 2 (10 points)\nYou notice that the Manhattan plots for salt tolerance and glucose/fructose utilisation share a peak on chromosome 3, but also have trait-specific peaks.\n\nDescribe what an overlapping peak for both traits suggests about the underlying genetics of those traits. (3 points)\nState one additional analysis you could carry out to test whether the same causal variant influences both traits. (2 points)\nExplain how recombination could help resolve a situation where beneficial alleles for two traits are on different haplotypes. (3 points)\nIdentify one environmental measurement you would collect alongside the genomic data to interpret potential trade-offs between the two traits, and justify your choice. (2 points)"

There is weak support that they affect the trait.

This means that very significant P-values (e.g., P = 1 × 10^−9.5) will show as high points on the plot (e.g., at position 9.5 on the vertical y-axis in this case).\n\n\nAll the non-significant SNPs (e.g., P = 0.1, which is 1 × 10^−1) will be at the bottom of the y-axis. If most variants have small or no effects on traits, there will be many of these.\nThis illustrates polygenic architecture: many variants with small effects and a few with larger effects."

To recap, quantitative traits are often described as complex traits, because they are affected by genetic variation in many genes. The genetic variants in the genes each account for a small proportion of the trait variation. We usually assume that the contribute in an additive way (rather than more complex ways).\nOne good way to identify loci controlling quantitative traits is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study, or GWAS. GWAS experiments use diversity panels of individuals to identify genetic markers that are significantly associated with a trait of interest.\nUsing a diversity panel instead of a bi parental mapping population ensures that linkage disequilibrium is low (bits of co-inherited DNA are small), and therefore resolution is high (QTL sizes are small), which helps to narrow down the regions containing the genes controlling the trait. They also capture much more genetic variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative traits and evolution\n\n\n\nMost traits are quantitative, and are caused by multiple genetic variants.

    "text": "2.2 Fission yeast\nIn this workshop we’ll use data from the fission yeast Schizosacharomyces pombe, which is a model species for cell biology. You can read more here about S. pombe here.\nWhen fission yeast is not being used in labs as a model species for cell biology, it usually grows on fruit. It is most often found in high-sugar fruits or in fermented beverages (wine, beer, and quite often in cachaça in Brazil).\n\n\nFigure 1. The fission yeast Schizosacharomyces pombe.  Fission yeast is an excellent model system. It is easy to grow in the laboratory, easy to transform, and it has a very small genome (12 Mb). It has ~5,000 protein coding genes, and ~1500 non-coding RNAs. It is haploid. Fission yeast and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not closely related fungi, so study of both has contributed vastly to our understanding of molecular biology, and to evolutionary biology and quantitative genetics.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 GWAS for yeast\nGWAS is usually used for human or crop traits, but of course we can apply this method to any recombing sexually-recombining eukaryotic species where we have trait data and polymorphism data (eg: SNPs).\nThe data we will use is from two papers from Nature Genetics, and Nature Communications. These articles described the genetic diversity of 160 strains of this species by sequencing their genomes. We also measured over 200 traits.\nIn this workshop we will examine some GWAS results for four traits, and think about what these results could mean for the evolution of this species.\n\n\n2.4 The traits\nThe traits we will look at today are:\nGrowth in 400mM NaCl The growth rate of the strains in 400 mM salt. This could be important if strains grew in fruit near the sea, for example.\nGrowth at an elevated temperature The growth rate of the strains at 40 degrees centigrade. This is quite warm for this yeast, so it’s a stressful condition.\nMaximal cell density in rich media This trait measures how well each strain grows, if it’s given plenty of sugar and other resources.\nGlucose/fructose utlisation level in wine How much of the glucose and fructose sugars each strain used in grape must (which is used to make wine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraits and trade-offs\n\n\n\nA high value in one of these traits could be adaptive one environment. But it ma be sub-optimal in another environment. Also, optimising one trait may limit another trait. This could be vbause one mutation may result in multiple changes, or the alleles that influence two traits are closely linked.\n\n\n\n\n3 Exercises\n\n3.1 Exploring the data\nFirst, clear all the previous data you may have in R, set your working directory, and load the new data.\nTo set a working directory you can either use a command (as below), or use the menus;\nSession &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory.\n\n#clear all the previous data\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#set working directory\n#your working directory will be different!\nsetwd(\"/Users/dj757/gd/modules/BIO56I/workshops/gwas\")\n\n#load the data\nload(url(\"http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dj757/BIO00056I/data/gwas-data.Rda\"))\n\nAfter loading this data you’ll then have four data frames of data called gluc, heat, rich and salt. Each of these data frames contains the GWAS results for one trait. Let’s start by looking at one table, salt.\nTry these commands to see what the contain:\n\n#examine what is in the salt data frame\nhead(salt)\nnrow(salt)\nsummary(salt)\nView(salt)\n\nThis table contains the output from GWAS program called LDAK. This is one of man software tools that run GWAS analysis. It describes the association of each SNP with the trait of salt tolerance.\nEach row of the table contains information about a SNP. For our purposes, the important columns are:\n\nWald_P, the P-value, the probability that this SNP is associated with this trait\nChr, which chromosome the SNP is on\nBP, the position of the SNP in the chromosome\nEffect_size, how strongly this variant effects the trait\n\nThe effect size of the variant estimates the proportion of trait variation that is explained by this SNP. From our understanding of The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, we know that most variants are selectively neutral. ie: they have little or no effect on fitness.\nGiven this, we might expect that most variants have small, or no effect, on traits.\n\n\n3.2 Manhattan plot\nA Manhattan plot is a standard way of viewing GWAS results. They are named Manhattan plots because they resemble the skyline of a highrise city, such as Manhattan Island (New York).\nManhattan plots show the position of the SNP on the x axis, and the p-value of the association on the y axis. P-alues are plotted as -log10(P), so that very small p-values end up at the top of the plot, and stand out.\nThe code below will make a Manhattan plot for the salt trait.\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #make a subset of SNPs from this chromosome\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      #plot these\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\",j),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      #draw a threshold line\n      #SNPs above this line are statistically associated with the trait\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\nWe see a small number* of very low P-values, with -log10 values they are at the top** of the y axis. For these, there is strong support that the affect the trait.\nThen, there are a large number with P-values of around 0.1 or greater. These are at the *bottom** of the y axis. There is weak support that the affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-log10 scale plotting\n\n\n\nNote that we use plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P) to plot the Wald_P P-values on a negative log scale. This means that very significant P-values (eg: P = 1 x 10-9.5), will show as high points on the plot (eg: at position 9.5 on the vertical y axis in this case).\n\n\nAll the non-signifcant SNPs (eg: P = 0.1, which is P = 1 x 10-1) will be at the bottom of the y axis. If most variants have small effects, or no effects on traits, there will be many of these.\nThis shows how GWAS relates to other areas of evolutionary theory.\n\n\n3.3 SNP effect sizes\nThe strength of the association between the genotype and the phenotype is related to the effect size of the variant (how strongly it affects the trait). Some alleles will affect the trait very strongly, others not so much. Now let’s look at how large the effect sizes are, by making a histogram of all the effect sizes.\n\nhist(salt$Effect_size,br=30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondider this result\n\n\n\n\nWhat this histogram tell you about SNP effect sizes?\nIs this consistent with The Neutral Theory of Moleclar Evolution?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 How does this influence evolution?\nThe effect size of a variant is the proportion of the phenotypic variance that the SNP explains. We can see that most of the effect sizes are very small. Most are smaller than 0.05, meaning that they produce an effect that is much smaller than 5% of the trait. They have tiny effects on the trait.\nAt this point let’s think about how such tiny effect alleles might influence evolutionary change.\nA selective sweep is a process where a beneficial mutation becomes fixed in a population rapidly, removing the genetic variation around the selected allele. Ask yourself:\n\nIf a trait is caused by small number of large effect mutations, would we expect to observe a selective sweep?\nWhat about a trait with a large number of mutations with very tiny effects?\nWould we expect to observe a selective sweep if a large effect mutation lies very close to a deleterious allele?\n\n\n\n3.5 Another trait: glucose & fructose use\nIn a vineyard environment, where this yeast grows, it will be an advantage to be able to metabolise the glucose and fructose in the rotting fruit. The glucose/fructose use is in the gluc data frame.\nAgain, we will look at the P-values Wald_P and how much each SNP is predcited to affect the trait (Effect_size).\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      temp = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\", j, \"Gluc\"),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n\n\nAgain, we see a small number of very low P-values, with -log10 values they are at the top of the y axis. For these, there is strong support that the affect the trait.\nThen, there are a large number with P-values of around 0.1 or greater. These are at the bottom of the y axis. There is weak support that the affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\nNow, make a histogram of the effect sizes:\n\nhist(gluc$Effect_size)\n\n\n\n3.6 Looking at two traits\nSpecies are not able to adapt simply to one condition, like heat or salt stress, because the natural environment is complex, and it changes from day to day. As a thought experiment, we will consider this using the fission yeast data.\nWe will compare the two Manhattan plots by plotting them on top of each other. We will plot the salt results in black, and the glucose metabolism results in red, and write the plot output to a pdf file. This pdf will appear in your working directory.\n\n#open the pdf writer\npdf(\"GWAS-plot3.pdf\",width=60)\n#set up the plot layout\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n#loop through chromosomes\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #plot the salt GWAS points (black dots)\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),main = \"\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\")\n      \n      #add the glucose/fructose GWAS points (red crosses)\n      temp2 = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      points(temp2$BP, -log10(temp2$Wald_P),main = \"gluc\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\",col=2,pch=3)\n      \n      #add the significance threshold\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n#close the pdf writer\ndev.off()\n\nNow find the pdf called GWAS-plot3.pdf and take a look.\n\n3.6.1 Might mutations for two traits conflict?\nLook at that significant peak on chromosome 3, at position ~1,500,000. Remember, this will have a large effect size. See how there is also an important variant for glucose & fructose use on chromosome 3, near the same position.\nLet’s consider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex (which all environments are). In this case, we consider an environment which is salty, but has plenty of fructose. A coastal vineyard, for example.\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhaplotypes\n\n\n\nIn a physical sense a haplotype is a length of DNA from one chromosome. For diploid species such as yourself tht have a paternal and a maternal chromosome, this is easy to understand.\nBut for fission yeast is haploid (one copy of each chromosome), what does this mean? We can think of different haplotypes as different versions of the chromosome that exist within the population. Each will carry it’s own SNPs.\nThrough meiotic recombination, haplotypes will be mixed. But SNPs that are very close together on the chromosome will not become separated very often. So they will usually travel together.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Haplotype problems\nCondider these situations:\n\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\nWhat might happen if the two helpful alleles are on different (opposing) haplotypes?\n\nThe figures below will help to explain.\n Figure 2. Beneficial alleles on one haplotype. Would there be any ‘conflict’ here?\n\n Figure 3. Beneficial alleles on two different haplotypes. What might happen here? What would the problem be?\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Summary: what we have learned\nThis workshop used data from fission yeast, but the principles apply to quantitative traits in general. Some general principles we can obtain are:\n\nMost SNPs do not strongly associate with traits.\nMost SNPs have very small effects on traits, but some do have detectable effects.\nSNPs do not affect all traits at once. Some SNPs affect one trait, some affect another.\nGenetic variants, like SNPs, ‘travel’ through time and space in haplotypes\n\n\n\n5 After the workshop: exam style questions\nIn exam questions, we often ask you to apply principles we have learned in workshops to other species, or other situations. Here are some examples to think about. Thinking about these situations will help to improve our grasp of the principes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of quantitative genetics\n\n\n\n\nMost SNPs have no effect, or very small effects, on traits.\nSNPs that do affect traits, are generally responsible for less than 5% of the trait variation.\nEffect sizes are also small for other genetic variants, such as transposon insertions, duplications/deletions and so on.\nGenetic variants can affect one trait, or several.\nIn the short term, selection occurs on haplotypes, but over time recombination will separate linked variants.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.1 Question 1. Why do we observe that most genetic variants have small effects on traits?\nHint: There are two was to anwser this one. a) To think about what we would expect to happen over time to variants that do have large effects. Consider those with large negative (deleterious) effects first, then those that are large and advantagous. b) To consider The Neutral Theory of Moleclar Evolution and molecular biology. If you change one amino acid in one protein, how much would you expect this to affect fitness? What about one synonymous mutation?\n\n\n5.0.2 Question 2. Imagine we observe that a fungicde-resistant fungus is spread though a country, destroying crops.\nWe know that this fungicde-resistance is new, so we hypothesise that a new mutation has occured. We can culture this fungus in the laboratory and measure their fungicde-resistance. How could we use quantiative genetics and population genetics together to find out what is happening?"

These articles described the genetic diversity of 160 strains of this species by sequencing their genomes.

This is quite warm for this yeast, so it’s a stressful condition.\nMaximal cell density in rich media This trait measures how well each strain grows, if it’s given plenty of sugar and other resources.\nGlucose/fructose utlisation level in wine How much of the glucose and fructose sugars each strain used in grape must (which is used to make wine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraits and trade-offs\n\n\n\nA high value in one of these traits could be adaptive one environment. But it ma be sub-optimal in another environment. Also, optimising one trait may limit another trait. This could be vbause one mutation may result in multiple changes, or the alleles that influence two traits are closely linked."
