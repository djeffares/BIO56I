    "text": "2.1 Background\nIn the lectures, we learnt about quantitative traits and how to analyse them. To recap, quantitative traits are often described as complex traits, because they are affected by genetic variation in many genes. The genetic variants in the genes each account for a small proportion of the trait variation. We usually assume that the contribute in an additive way (rather than more complex ways).\nOne good way to identify loci controlling quantitative traits is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study, or GWAS. GWAS experiments use diversity panels of individuals to identify genetic markers that are significantly associated with a trait of interest.\nUsing a diversity panel instead of a bi parental mapping population ensures that linkage disequilibrium is low (bits of co-inherited DNA are small), and therefore resolution is high (QTL sizes are small), which helps to narrow down the regions containing the genes controlling the trait. They also capture much more genetic variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative traits and evolution\n\n\n\nMost traits are quantitative, and are caused by multiple genetic variants. This means that:\n\nWe expect traits to adapt gradually, as a few variants change\nWe do not expect to observe many strong selective sweeps"

See how there is also an important variant for glucose & fructose use on chromosome 3, near the same position.\nLet’s consider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex (which all environments are).

We can think of different haplotypes as different versions of the chromosome that exist within the population. Each will carry it’s own SNPs.\nThrough meiotic recombination, haplotypes will be mixed.
