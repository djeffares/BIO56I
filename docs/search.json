Plasmodium falciparum is a single celled eukaryotic parasite that causes malaria. P. falciparum infections are restricted to humans and the parasite is transmitted from person to person by mosquitos. The life cycle involved sexual recombination, with the haploid male and female forms developing within the human host which form diploid zygotes in the mosquito. Malaraia infections are treated with drugs, but mutations occur in thsi parasite that result in drug resistance occur from time to time.\nMore than 20,000 P. falciparum genomes have been sequenced. The parasites were collected from Africa, South America, South East Asia and Oceania (countries in the Pacific ocean). The majority were collected between the years 2000 and 2020. From these genomes, 3 million SNPs were identified, enabling many different population genetic analyses.\n\nGiven your knowledge about population genomics, explain why collecting and sequencing the genomes of 20,000 P. falciparum strains is useful for malaria control and elimination? In your answer, describe some questions about P. falciparum biology that we could not answer from just one single P. falciparum genome, but could answer from the large population genomics data set we have now. (10 marks, 10 lines)\n\nModel Answer: Population structure: are P. falciparum parasites divided into populations that are genetically different? (2). Genome scale genetic diversity: Are different populations more or less diverse? (2). Gene diversity studies, selection and cell biology: Which genes have higher or lower genetic diversity? (1). Can we identify genes that appear to be subject to balancing selection, strong purifying selection, or selective sweeps (2-3). Migration analyses: Where are parasites migrating to/from? (1) By what routes are drug resistance alleles migrating? (2)\n\nSome of the P. falciparum genomes are from the progeny crosses of strains. What could we find out by sequencing many progeny (eg: about 300) of a cross between a drug resistant strain and a drug susceptible strain. In your answer, describe:\nWhat we could discover from such an experiment, and what value this would have?\n\n\nWhat analysis method(s) could we use to discover this information?\nIn addition to genomes, what other information would we require about the 300 strains we sequenced?\nAssuming our parental strains are ‘wild’ strains collected from patients, and not laboratory-adapted strains, would it be wiser to choose the parental strains from the same location (eg: one village in Ghana), or from two geographically distant regions (eg: Ghana and Brazil)? Justify your answer based on aspects of population genetics.\nDrug resistance appears to spread rapidly, within counrties and between continents.

To recap, quantitative traits are often described as complex traits, because they are affected by genetic variation in many genes. The genetic variants in the genes each account for a small proportion of the trait variation. We usually assume that the contribute in an additive way (rather than more complex ways).\nOne good way to identify loci controlling quantitative traits is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study, or GWAS. GWAS experiments use diversity panels of individuals to identify genetic markers that are significantly associated with a trait of interest.\nUsing a diversity panel instead of a bi parental mapping population ensures that linkage disequilibrium is low (bits of co-inherited DNA are small), and therefore resolution is high (QTL sizes are small), which helps to narrow down the regions containing the genes controlling the trait. They also capture much more genetic variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative traits and evolution\n\n\n\nMost traits are quantitative, and are caused by multiple genetic variants. This means that:\n\nWe expect traits to adapt gradually, as a few variants change\nWe do not expect to observe many strong selective sweeps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlossary\n\n\n\nTechnical definitions for this workshop.\n\nSchizosacharomyces pombe:\nGWAS:\ntrait :\nManhattan plot:\nQTL:\nhaplotype:\nselective sweep:"

    "text": "2.2 Fission yeast\nIn this workshop we’ll use data from the fission yeast Schizosacharomyces pombe, which is a model species for cell biology. You can read more here about S. pombe here.\nWhen fission yeast is not being used in labs as a model species for cell biology, it usually grows on fruit. It is most often found in high-sugar fruits or in fermented beverages (wine, beer, and quite often in cachaça in Brazil).\n\n\nFigure 1. The fission yeast Schizosacharomyces pombe.  Fission yeast is an excellent model system. It is easy to grow in the laboratory, easy to transform, and it has a very small genome (12 Mb). It has ~5,000 protein coding genes, and ~1500 non-coding RNAs. It is haploid. Fission yeast and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not closely related fungi, so study of both has contributed vastly to our understanding of molecular biology, and to evolutionary biology and quantitative genetics.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 GWAS for yeast\nGWAS is usually used for human or crop traits, but of course we can apply this method to any recombing sexually-recombining eukaryotic species where we have trait data and polymorphism data (eg: SNPs).\nThe data we will use is from two papers from Nature Genetics, and Nature Communications. These articles described the genetic diversity of 160 strains of this species by sequencing their genomes. We also measured over 200 traits.\nIn this workshop we will examine some GWAS results for four traits, and think about what these results could mean for the evolution of this species.\n\n\n2.4 The traits\nThe traits we will look at today are:\nGrowth in 400mM NaCl The growth rate of the strains in 400 mM salt. This could be important if strains grew in fruit near the sea, for example.\nGrowth at an elevated temperature The growth rate of the strains at 40 degrees centigrade. This is quite warm for this yeast, so it’s a stressful condition.\nMaximal cell density in rich media This trait measures how well each strain grows, if it’s given plenty of sugar and other resources.\nGlucose/fructose utlisation level in wine How much of the glucose and fructose sugars each strain used in grape must (which is used to make wine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraits and trade-offs\n\n\n\nA high value in one of these traits could be adaptive one environment. But it ma be sub-optimal in another environment. Also, optimising one trait may limit another trait. This could be vbause one mutation may result in multiple changes, or the alleles that influence two traits are closely linked.\n\n\n\n\n3 Exercises\n\n3.1 Exploring the data\nFirst, clear all the previous data you may have in R, set your working directory, and load the new data.\nTo set a working directory you can either use a command (as below), or use the menus;\nSession &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory.\n\n#clear all the previous data\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#set working directory\n#your working directory will be different!\nsetwd(\"/Users/dj757/gd/modules/BIO56I/workshops/gwas\")\n\n#load the data\nload(url(\"http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dj757/BIO00056I/data/gwas-data.Rda\"))\n\nAfter loading this data you’ll then have four data frames of data called gluc, heat, rich and salt. Each of these data frames contains the GWAS results for one trait. Let’s start by looking at one table, salt.\nTry these commands to see what the contain:\n\n#examine what is in the salt data frame\nhead(salt)\nnrow(salt)\nsummary(salt)\nView(salt)\n\nThis table contains the output from GWAS program called LDAK. This is one of man software tools that run GWAS analysis. It describes the association of each SNP with the trait of salt tolerance.\nEach row of the table contains information about a SNP. For our purposes, the important columns are:\n\nWald_P, the P-value, the probability that this SNP is associated with this trait\nChr, which chromosome the SNP is on\nBP, the position of the SNP in the chromosome\nEffect_size, how strongly this variant effects the trait\n\nThe effect size of the variant estimates the proportion of trait variation that is explained by this SNP. From our understanding of The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, we know that most variants are selectively neutral. ie: they have little or no effect on fitness.\nGiven this, we might expect that most variants have small, or no effect, on traits.\n\n\n3.2 Manhattan plot\nA Manhattan plot is a standard way of viewing GWAS results. They are named Manhattan plots because they resemble the skyline of a highrise city, such as Manhattan Island (New York).\nManhattan plots show the position of the SNP on the x axis, and the p-value of the association on the y axis. P-alues are plotted as -log10(P), so that very small p-values end up at the top of the plot, and stand out.\nThe code below will make a Manhattan plot for the salt trait.\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #make a subset of SNPs from this chromosome\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      #plot these\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\",j),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      #draw a threshold line\n      #SNPs above this line are statistically associated with the trait\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\nWe see a small number* of very low P-values, with -log10 values they are at the top** of the y axis. For these, there is strong support that the affect the trait.\nThen, there are a large number with P-values of around 0.1 or greater. These are at the *bottom** of the y axis. There is weak support that the affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-log10 scale plotting\n\n\n\nNote that we use plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P) to plot the Wald_P P-values on a negative log scale. This means that very significant P-values (eg: P = 1 x 10-9.5), will show as high points on the plot (eg: at position 9.5 on the vertical y axis in this case).\n\n\nAll the non-signifcant SNPs (eg: P = 0.1, which is P = 1 x 10-1) will be at the bottom of the y axis. If most variants have small effects, or no effects on traits, there will be many of these.\nThis shows how GWAS relates to other areas of evolutionary theory.\n\n\n3.3 SNP effect sizes\nThe strength of the association between the genotype and the phenotype is related to the effect size of the variant (how strongly it affects the trait). Some alleles will affect the trait very strongly, others not so much. Now let’s look at how large the effect sizes are, by making a histogram of all the effect sizes.\n\nhist(salt$Effect_size,br=30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondider this result\n\n\n\n\nWhat this histogram tell you about SNP effect sizes?\nIs this consistent with The Neutral Theory of Moleclar Evolution?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 How does this influence evolution?\nThe effect size of a variant is the proportion of the phenotypic variance that the SNP explains. We can see that most of the effect sizes are very small. Most are smaller than 0.05, meaning that they produce an effect that is much smaller than 5% of the trait. They have tiny effects on the trait.\nAt this point let’s think about how such tiny effect alleles might influence evolutionary change.\nA selective sweep is a process where a beneficial mutation becomes fixed in a population rapidly, removing the genetic variation around the selected allele. Ask yourself:\n\nIf a trait is caused by small number of large effect mutations, would we expect to observe a selective sweep?\nWhat about a trait with a large number of mutations with very tiny effects?\nWould we expect to observe a selective sweep if a large effect mutation lies very close to a deleterious allele?\n\n\n\n3.5 Another trait: glucose & fructose use\nIn a vineyard environment, where this yeast grows, it will be an advantage to be able to metabolise the glucose and fructose in the rotting fruit. The glucose/fructose use is in the gluc data frame.\nAgain, we will look at the P-values Wald_P and how much each SNP is predcited to affect the trait (Effect_size).\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      temp = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\", j, \"Gluc\"),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n\n\nAgain, we see a small number of very low P-values, with -log10 values they are at the top of the y axis. For these, there is strong support that the affect the trait.\nThen, there are a large number with P-values of around 0.1 or greater. These are at the bottom of the y axis. There is weak support that the affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\nNow, make a histogram of the effect sizes:\n\nhist(gluc$Effect_size)\n\n\n\n3.6 Looking at two traits\nSpecies are not able to adapt simply to one condition, like heat or salt stress, because the natural environment is complex, and it changes from day to day.

Remember, this will have a large effect size. See how there is also an important variant for glucose & fructose use on chromosome 3, near the same position.\nLet’s consider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex (which all environments are). In this case, we consider an environment which is salty, but has plenty of fructose. A coastal vineyard, for example.\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhaplotypes\n\n\n\nIn a physical sense a haplotype is a length of DNA from one chromosome. For diploid species such as yourself tht have a paternal and a maternal chromosome, this is easy to understand.\nBut for fission yeast is haploid (one copy of each chromosome), what does this mean? We can think of different haplotypes as different versions of the chromosome that exist within the population. Each will carry it’s own SNPs.\nThrough meiotic recombination, haplotypes will be mixed. But SNPs that are very close together on the chromosome will not become separated very often. So they will usually travel together.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Haplotype problems\nCondider these situations:\n\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\nWhat might happen if the two helpful alleles are on different (opposing) haplotypes?\n\nThe figures below will help to explain.\n Figure 2. Beneficial alleles on one haplotype. Would there be any ‘conflict’ here?\n\n Figure 3. Beneficial alleles on two different haplotypes. What might happen here? What would the problem be?\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Summary: what we have learned\nThis workshop used data from fission yeast, but the principles apply to quantitative traits in general. Some general principles we can obtain are:\n\nMost SNPs do not strongly associate with traits.\nMost SNPs have very small effects on traits, but some do have detectable effects.\nSNPs do not affect all traits at once. Some SNPs affect one trait, some affect another.\nGenetic variants, like SNPs, ‘travel’ through time and space in haplotypes\n\n\n\n5 After the workshop: exam style questions\nIn exam questions, we often ask you to apply principles we have learned in workshops to other species, or other situations. Here are some examples to think about. Thinking about these situations will help to improve our grasp of the principes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of quantitative genetics\n\n\n\n\nMost SNPs have no effect, or very small effects, on traits.\nSNPs that do affect traits, are generally responsible for less than 5% of the trait variation.\nEffect sizes are also small for other genetic variants, such as transposon insertions, duplications/deletions and so on.\nGenetic variants can affect one trait, or several.\nIn the short term, selection occurs on haplotypes, but over time recombination will separate linked variants.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.1 Question 1. Why do we observe that most genetic variants have small effects on traits?\nHint: There are two was to anwser this one. a) To think about what we would expect to happen over time to variants that do have large effects. Consider those with large negative (deleterious) effects first, then those that are large and advantagous. b) To consider The Neutral Theory of Moleclar Evolution and molecular biology. If you change one amino acid in one protein, how much would you expect this to affect fitness? What about one synonymous mutation?\n\n\n5.0.2 Question 2. Imagine we observe that a fungicde-resistant fungus is spread though a country, destroying crops.\nWe know that this fungicde-resistance is new, so we hypothesise that a new mutation has occured. We can culture this fungus in the laboratory and measure their fungicde-resistance. How could we use quantiative genetics and population genetics together to find out what is happening?"

However, we can test whether genetic distances increase linearly with time.\nTo address the issue of linearity between substitution rates and time, we can first compute genetic distances between the sequences grouped by years. To do this:\n\nGo to the Distance menu (at the top of the main Mega window)\nClick Compute Between Group Mean Distance (see image below)\nKeep the Kimura 2 parameter model\nClick OK\n\n\nYou should see the matrix shown below.\n\nNext, export this data to a file:\n\nIn the matrix window, click on the File menu\nThen Export/Print Distances\nOutput format: text\nExport Type: column\n\nYou should see a window something like the image below.\n\nFinally edit and save this file: - Remove all the text above Species1 Species2 Distance - Remove the text below the data table, “Table. Estimates of Evolutionary Divergence over Sequence …” etc\n\nEdit the Species1 Species2 Distance text to date1 date1 Distance\nChoose File &gt; Save As\nName the file H3N2_wellington.distances.txt\n\nYou can also obtain a copy of this file here."

The insects feed on human and/or animal blood. They pick up the pathogen from the skin of an infected person or animal when they feed, and transfer the pathogen to another person or animal. Such insects are called the vector of the pathogen.\nReservoirs: Some pathogens and the insect vectors feed on animals as well as people. A large number of pathogens can be present in the animal population. An animal that contains pathogens is called a reservoir species. A pathogen can have more than one reservoir species."

Being able to tell when outbreaks occur, as well as where, can be a very powerful tool as it can supplement what we can see from epidemiology.

Genetically, a population is a group of individuals more closely related to each other than to other groups, reflecting shared ancestry.\n\nIn practice, it can be hard to tell which population—or even which species—an individual belongs to, especially for microorganisms. In this workshop, we’ll use genome data to investigate these questions\nIn Figure 1 below, each box represents a population that contains mant individuals. Red and blue boxes represent two species. Some regions have hybrids (mixed colors), and some do not. Some populations show a little mixing; others show a lot.\n Figure 1: Imagined populations of two species (red and blue), with some hybrids and varying levels of mixing."

    "text": "2.2 The topic for today\nIn this workshop, we’ll look at new genome data from Leishmania parasites collected in the Amazon. Leishmania are single-celled protozoan parasites that infect mammals, including people. They have two copies of each chromosome (diploid) and reproduce sexually (they undergo meiosis).\nWe’ll focus on Leishmania guyanensis and closely related species found in South America. Together they form a species complex called Viannia—closely related species that can sometimes interbreed where their ranges overlap.\nThese parasites cause cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a skin disease that leads to long-lasting sores. CL is zoonotic, meaning it mostly circulates in wild animals; humans are infected but probably play a small role in maintaining the parasite population.\nBecause Viannia parasites infect many native mammals in South America, they are probably deeply embedded in the region’s ecology.\n\n2.2.1 Leishmania are spread by sand flies\nThree facts about sand flies are important for today:\n\nSand flies are mainly found in forests or forest edges (not in sand on the beach)\nThey are not strong flyers, so they don’t carry Leishmania parasites very long distances.\nThe different sand flies species, and even populations within species, have their own ecological niches and characteristics.\n\nFor example, certain populations of sand flies carry some species of Leishmania, but not others."

The analysis is being carried out at the University of York, working with colleagues in Manaus, Brazil—a large city on the Amazon River surrounded by the Amazon Rainforest. Because the Amazon is so biodiverse, several Viannia species may be present there.\nParasites were isolated from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and grown in the lab to extract DNA. We then sequenced the DNA from 70+ parasites using short-read (Illumina) sequencing.\nFrom these genomes, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—tiny differences at single DNA letters. To add context, we also included public data for related Viannia species from the European Nucleotide Archive. A short summary of the computational steps is at the end of this document.\nFor this workshop, all you need to know is that we have SNP data from:\n\n71 Leishmania strains collected in Manaus (mostly likely to be L. guyanensis)\n21 L. braziliensis strains from various locations in Brazil\n25 L. panamensis strains from Panama\n34 L. peruviana strains from Peru\none L.shawi strain from Brazil\n\nWe’ll use these data to explore species, populations, and mixing (hybridization) within the Viannia group."

    "section": "3.1 Exploring the data",
    "text": "3.1 Exploring the data\nIn this workshop we will explore the results we generated. We will look at three ways to visualise population structure.\n\n3.1.1 Population genomic data files\nWhile genomes contain many types of polymorphisms, population genomic analysis often uses only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data. This is because SNPs are very abundant and they have some properties that make them easier to model mathematically.\nSNPs and other polymorphisms are affected by many processes, such as genetic drift, migration, selection and recombination. However, it can be represented relatively simply as a table.\nTeh standard format for representing SNP data is called VCF (Variant Call Format). Here is a small example of what a VCF file looks like.\n#CHROM  POS REF ALT Lg1 Lg2 Lg3 Lg3\n01  2177    A   G   0/1 1/1 1/1 0/1\n01  2636    G   A   0/0 0/1 0/1 0/0\n01  9844    G   A   0/1 0/0 0/0 0/0\n...\n35  9999    G   A   1/1 0/0 0/1 0/0\nIt is almost like a table that we could lod into Excel, where each row indicates position in the genome, and columns contain information about that position.\nIt has a header line:\n#CHROM POS REF ALT\nThis indicates that the first column is the chromosome number (#CHROM), the second column is the position on that chromosome (POS), the third column is the reference allele (REF) and the fourth column is the alternative allele (ALT).\nAfter this, we have the genotypes for each sample. In this example, there are four samples:\nLg1 Lg2 Lg3 Lg3\nAfter this, we have the genotypes for the strains that are in the VCF (four in this case). They are coded as 0 for the reference allele (A), 1 for the second allele (G), so for an A/G polymorphism:\n\nAA is coded as 0/0\nAG is coded as 0/1\nGG is coded as 1/1\n\nThe population genomics community has developed many software tools that process this data to extract some of this information (no tool does it all). In this workshop we will look at a phylogenetic tree, principal components analysis (PCA) and a STRUCTURE plot. These are all used to describe population structure and detect hybrids between populations or between species."

    "section": "3.2 The phylogeny",
    "text": "3.2 The phylogeny\nA phylogenetic tree is a good first look at how similar or different many samples are. But when individuals mix between populations or species (hybridization), a simple branching tree can be misleading.\nThink of a tree of people grouped by ancestry. Where would you place someone with one parent from Spain and one from Fiji? They don’t fit neatly on a single branch with the Spanish and the Fijians. The same data display issue can happen in nature when populations interbreed.\nTo handle this, we used a network approach (a splits network made with the software SplitsTree) that can show conflicting signals in the data—like those caused by mixing between populations or species.\nBelow is our SplitsTree network. There are many samples, so coloured dots cluster tightly. The Manaus samples are dark blue. Most cluster near Leishmania guyanensis at the top. We marked the Manaus samples that don’t with arrows.\n Figure 2: A SplitsTree phylogeny. The overall phylgeny is in the center, and we zoom in to various clades (groups of related samples) around the edges. Each dot is a sample, coloured by species. The dark blue dots are samples we collected from Manaus, Brazil.\n\n3.2.1 Interpeting phylogeny\nNow spend some time discussing the SplitsTree phylogeny, using the using the discussion points below as a guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: phylogeny\n\n\n\n\nFrom this figure, do the Viannia species look clearly separated or do some overlap?\nA few Manaus samples don’t cluster with L. guyanensis. What could explain that?\nWhat might this suggest about the causes of CL in the Amazon (e.g., multiple species, local ecology, host/vector differences)?\nLook at the L. peruviana–L. braziliensis area (red box). One strain sits between the two. What could that indicate?\nExamine the data from the single L. shawi sample (light blue). Does its branch look unusually long? Remember: longer branches usually mean more mutations (this isn’t a dated tree, just a measure of genetic differences)."

    "section": "3.3 Principal components clustering",
    "text": "3.3 Principal components clustering\nPopulation structure is an important facet of most (if not all) species. Populations sometimes split into species, and all natural selection begins within a population. So when we start to examine the genetic diversity of a species, it is wise to look at population structure.\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) is a useful tool for understanding population structure. PCA reduces the variables in our data set (thousands of SNPs in our rows, and many individuals in columns), while preserving a lot of the information about population structure.\nA simple way to interpret PCA data is by considering that the distance between two individuals on a two-dimensional PCA plot is a representation of the genetic distance between those samples. So, if they are close on the plot, they are close genetically. And if they are distant in the plot, they are distant genetically. We would expect individuals from within a population, or a species to fall close to each other on a PCA plot.\nFirst look at Figure 3 below. This shows PCA clustering of all the other Viannia species, apart from the samples we collected from Manaus. Discuss with the people at your table:\n\nDo the species cluster genetically?\nDo L. peruviana and L. braziliensis really look like two different species?\n\nNote: The blue dashed lines are a guide to the eye to help you see the clusters.\n Figure 3. PCA clustering of all the other Viannia species from thoughout South America\nNow look at Figure 4, which shows PCA clustering of all the other Viannia species from throughout South America (on the left), and those that were collected from Manaus (on the right). Note that the PC axes are on the same scale here.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. PCA clustering of all the Leishmania samples from thoughout South America (left), and those that were collected from Manaus (right)\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Interpeting principal component plots\nTo learn to interpret principal components plots, using the using the discussion points below for a discuss with the people at your table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA (species)\n\n\n\n\nDoes it look like the samples that came from Manaus are all the same species?\nSince we ensured the positions on the PCA plot identify the species, does it help to identify the species from Manaus?\nWhat does this tell you about the causes of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Amazon region?\nSince Leishmania are single celled organisms, and they all cause a similar disease, population genomics is the only way to identify which sample belongs to which species. Why would we not merely use PCR to identify the species?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Principal components clustering 2: geography and genetics\nWe can look at the PC plots another way, simply by colouring the samples according to where they came from (geography).\nBecause sand flies that carry Leishmania do not fly very far, it is possible that geographic distance is the main factor that determines the genetic distance between Leishmania populations. This concept is called isolation by distance.\nThe Leishmania parasite we have genome data from come from Brazil, Peru and Panama which are very far apart, so we might expect to see isolation by distance in the PCA plot.\nNote that in Figure 4 below: - the colour of each point indicates the location where the sample was collected - the position on the PCA plot indicated how closely related each sample is. If two strains sit close together on the plot, they are closely related genetically.\n\n\nFigure 4. PCA clustering of all the other Viannia species from throughout South America. The blue dashed lines are not important here, but will help with interpretation of Figure 5 below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA and isolation by distance\n\n\n\nNote that samples from the same country are plotted in the same colour, and samples that are genetically similar will be fall close together on the plot.\n\nDo you see any examples of genetically similar that are all from the same country? These will be one local population of the same species. This is what we expect, from a local population that is one species.\nDo you see any examples of the opposite: genetically similar samples that are close together on the PCA plot, with different colours showing that they are from different countries?\nHow can we interpret the finding that there are genetically similar individuals living in different countries? It might help to think about this with respect to human populations.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. PCA clustering of only the Leishmania strain we collected from Manaus. The PCA axes are the same as Figure 4 above. The blue will help with interpretation, compared to Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points: PCA and specis in Manaus\n\n\n\n\nSince samples that are genetically similar will be fall close together on the plot, does it look like all the samples from Manaus are the same species?\nWhat does this tell us about the causes of genetic differentiation between species?\nIn other words, why are all these Leishmania samples from Manaus not interbreeding, and becoming genetically related?\nCan you guess what species are present in Manaus, based on the coordinates of species in previous PCA plots?\nIs the idea that there are different Leishmania species in Manaus that we obtain from the PCA plots consistent with the phylogeny we looked at earlier?"

    "text": "2.1 Background\nIn the lectures, we learnt about quantitative traits and how to analyse them. To recap, quantitative traits are often described as complex traits, because they are affected by genetic variation in many genes. The genetic variants in the genes each account for a small proportion of the trait variation. We usually assume that the contribute in an additive way (rather than more complex ways).\nOne good way to identify loci controlling quantitative traits is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study, or GWAS. GWAS experiments use diversity panels of individuals to identify genetic markers that are significantly associated with a trait of interest.\nUsing a diversity panel instead of a bi parental mapping population ensures that linkage disequilibrium is low (bits of co-inherited DNA are small), and therefore resolution is high (QTL sizes are small), which helps to narrow down the regions containing the genes controlling the trait. They also capture much more genetic variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative traits and evolution\n\n\n\nMost traits are quantitative, and are caused by multiple genetic variants. This means that:\n\nWe expect traits to adapt gradually, as a few variants change\nWe do not expect to observe many strong selective sweeps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlossary\n\n\n\nTechnical definitions for this workshop.\n\nSchizosacharomyces pombe:\nGWAS:\ntrait :\nManhattan plot:\nQTL:\nhaplotype:\nselective sweep:"

    "text": "2.2 Fission yeast\nIn this workshop we’ll use data from the fission yeast Schizosacharomyces pombe, which is a model species for cell biology. You can read more here about S. pombe here.\nWhen fission yeast is not being used in labs as a model species for cell biology, it usually grows on fruit. It is most often found in high-sugar fruits or in fermented beverages (wine, beer, and quite often in cachaça in Brazil).\n\n\nFigure 1. The fission yeast Schizosacharomyces pombe.  Fission yeast is an excellent model system. It is easy to grow in the laboratory, easy to transform, and it has a very small genome (12 Mb). It has ~5,000 protein coding genes, and ~1500 non-coding RNAs. It is haploid. Fission yeast and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not closely related fungi, so study of both has contributed vastly to our understanding of molecular biology, and to evolutionary biology and quantitative genetics.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 GWAS for yeast\nGWAS is usually used for human or crop traits, but of course we can apply this method to any recombing sexually-recombining eukaryotic species where we have trait data and polymorphism data (eg: SNPs).\nThe data we will use is from two papers from Nature Genetics, and Nature Communications. These articles described the genetic diversity of 160 strains of this species by sequencing their genomes. We also measured over 200 traits.\nIn this workshop we will examine some GWAS results for four traits, and think about what these results could mean for the evolution of this species.\n\n\n2.4 The traits\nThe traits we will look at today are:\nGrowth in 400mM NaCl The growth rate of the strains in 400 mM salt. This could be important if strains grew in fruit near the sea, for example.\nGrowth at an elevated temperature The growth rate of the strains at 40 degrees centigrade. This is quite warm for this yeast, so it’s a stressful condition.\nMaximal cell density in rich media This trait measures how well each strain grows, if it’s given plenty of sugar and other resources.\nGlucose/fructose utlisation level in wine How much of the glucose and fructose sugars each strain used in grape must (which is used to make wine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraits and trade-offs\n\n\n\nA high value in one of these traits could be adaptive one environment. But it ma be sub-optimal in another environment. Also, optimising one trait may limit another trait. This could be vbause one mutation may result in multiple changes, or the alleles that influence two traits are closely linked.\n\n\n\n\n3 Exercises\n\n3.1 Exploring the data\nFirst, clear all the previous data you may have in R, set your working directory, and load the new data.\nTo set a working directory you can either use a command (as below), or use the menus;\nSession &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory.\n\n#clear all the previous data\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#set working directory\n#your working directory will be different!\nsetwd(\"/Users/dj757/gd/modules/BIO56I/workshops/gwas\")\n\n#load the data\nload(url(\"http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dj757/BIO00056I/data/gwas-data.Rda\"))\n\nAfter loading this data you’ll then have four data frames of data called gluc, heat, rich and salt. Each of these data frames contains the GWAS results for one trait. Let’s start by looking at one table, salt.\nTry these commands to see what the contain:\n\n#examine what is in the salt data frame\nhead(salt)\nnrow(salt)\nsummary(salt)\nView(salt)\n\nThis table contains the output from GWAS program called LDAK. This is one of man software tools that run GWAS analysis. It describes the association of each SNP with the trait of salt tolerance.\nEach row of the table contains information about a SNP. For our purposes, the important columns are:\n\nWald_P, the P-value, the probability that this SNP is associated with this trait\nChr, which chromosome the SNP is on\nBP, the position of the SNP in the chromosome\nEffect_size, how strongly this variant effects the trait\n\nThe effect size of the variant estimates the proportion of trait variation that is explained by this SNP. From our understanding of The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, we know that most variants are selectively neutral. ie: they have little or no effect on fitness.\nGiven this, we might expect that most variants have small, or no effect, on traits.\n\n\n3.2 Manhattan plot\nA Manhattan plot is a standard way of viewing GWAS results. They are named Manhattan plots because they resemble the skyline of a highrise city, such as Manhattan Island (New York).\nManhattan plots show the position of the SNP on the x axis, and the p-value of the association on the y axis. P-alues are plotted as -log10(P), so that very small p-values end up at the top of the plot, and stand out.\nThe code below will make a Manhattan plot for the salt trait.\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #make a subset of SNPs from this chromosome\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      #plot these\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\",j),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      #draw a threshold line\n      #SNPs above this line are statistically associated with the trait\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\nWe see a small number* of very low P-values, with -log10 values they are at the top** of the y axis. For these, there is strong support that the affect the trait.\nThen, there are a large number with P-values of around 0.1 or greater. These are at the *bottom** of the y axis. There is weak support that the affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-log10 scale plotting\n\n\n\nNote that we use plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P) to plot the Wald_P P-values on a negative log scale. This means that very significant P-values (eg: P = 1 x 10-9.5), will show as high points on the plot (eg: at position 9.5 on the vertical y axis in this case).\n\n\nAll the non-signifcant SNPs (eg: P = 0.1, which is P = 1 x 10-1) will be at the bottom of the y axis. If most variants have small effects, or no effects on traits, there will be many of these.\nThis shows how GWAS relates to other areas of evolutionary theory.\n\n\n3.3 SNP effect sizes\nThe strength of the association between the genotype and the phenotype is related to the effect size of the variant (how strongly it affects the trait). Some alleles will affect the trait very strongly, others not so much. Now let’s look at how large the effect sizes are, by making a histogram of all the effect sizes.\n\nhist(salt$Effect_size,br=30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondider this result\n\n\n\n\nWhat this histogram tell you about SNP effect sizes?\nIs this consistent with The Neutral Theory of Moleclar Evolution?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 How does this influence evolution?\nThe effect size of a variant is the proportion of the phenotypic variance that the SNP explains. We can see that most of the effect sizes are very small. Most are smaller than 0.05, meaning that they produce an effect that is much smaller than 5% of the trait. They have tiny effects on the trait.\nAt this point let’s think about how such tiny effect alleles might influence evolutionary change.\nA selective sweep is a process where a beneficial mutation becomes fixed in a population rapidly, removing the genetic variation around the selected allele. Ask yourself:\n\nIf a trait is caused by small number of large effect mutations, would we expect to observe a selective sweep?\nWhat about a trait with a large number of mutations with very tiny effects?\nWould we expect to observe a selective sweep if a large effect mutation lies very close to a deleterious allele?\n\n\n\n3.5 Another trait: glucose & fructose use\nIn a vineyard environment, where this yeast grows, it will be an advantage to be able to metabolise the glucose and fructose in the rotting fruit. The glucose/fructose use is in the gluc data frame.\nAgain, we will look at the P-values Wald_P and how much each SNP is predcited to affect the trait (Effect_size).\n\n#set plotting parameters\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n\n#loop through chromosomes 1,2,3, plotting each one in turn\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      temp = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),\n           main = paste(\"Chr\", j, \"Gluc\"),ylim=c(1,10),\n           xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\"\n      )\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n\n\n\nAgain, we see a small number of very low P-values, with -log10 values they are at the top of the y axis. For these, there is strong support that the affect the trait.\nThen, there are a large number with P-values of around 0.1 or greater. These are at the bottom of the y axis. There is weak support that the affect the trait. These may have tiny effect sizes, or none at all.\nNow, make a histogram of the effect sizes:\n\nhist(gluc$Effect_size)\n\n\n\n3.6 Looking at two traits\nSpecies are not able to adapt simply to one condition, like heat or salt stress, because the natural environment is complex, and it changes from day to day. As a thought experiment, we will consider this using the fission yeast data.\nWe will compare the two Manhattan plots by plotting them on top of each other. We will plot the salt results in black, and the glucose metabolism results in red, and write the plot output to a pdf file. This pdf will appear in your working directory.\n\n#open the pdf writer\npdf(\"GWAS-plot3.pdf\",width=60)\n#set up the plot layout\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n#loop through chromosomes\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #plot the salt GWAS points (black dots)\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),main = \"\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\")\n      \n      #add the glucose/fructose GWAS points (red crosses)\n      temp2 = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      points(temp2$BP, -log10(temp2$Wald_P),main = \"gluc\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\",col=2,pch=3)\n      \n      #add the significance threshold\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n#close the pdf writer\ndev.off()\n\nNow find the pdf called GWAS-plot3.pdf and take a look.\n\n3.6.1 Might mutations for two traits conflict?\nLook at that significant peak on chromosome 3, at position ~1,500,000. Remember, this will have a large effect size. See how there is also an important variant for glucose & fructose use on chromosome 3, near the same position.\nLet’s consider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex (which all environments are). In this case, we consider an environment which is salty, but has plenty of fructose. A coastal vineyard, for example.\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhaplotypes\n\n\n\nIn a physical sense a haplotype is a length of DNA from one chromosome. For diploid species such as yourself tht have a paternal and a maternal chromosome, this is easy to understand.\nBut for fission yeast is haploid (one copy of each chromosome), what does this mean? We can think of different haplotypes as different versions of the chromosome that exist within the population. Each will carry it’s own SNPs.\nThrough meiotic recombination, haplotypes will be mixed. But SNPs that are very close together on the chromosome will not become separated very often. So they will usually travel together.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Haplotype problems\nCondider these situations:\n\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\nWhat might happen if the two helpful alleles are on different (opposing) haplotypes?\n\nThe figures below will help to explain.\n Figure 2. Beneficial alleles on one haplotype. Would there be any ‘conflict’ here?\n\n Figure 3. Beneficial alleles on two different haplotypes. What might happen here? What would the problem be?\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Summary: what we have learned\nThis workshop used data from fission yeast, but the principles apply to quantitative traits in general. Some general principles we can obtain are:\n\nMost SNPs do not strongly associate with traits.\nMost SNPs have very small effects on traits, but some do have detectable effects.\nSNPs do not affect all traits at once. Some SNPs affect one trait, some affect another.\nGenetic variants, like SNPs, ‘travel’ through time and space in haplotypes\n\n\n\n5 After the workshop: exam style questions\nIn exam questions, we often ask you to apply principles we have learned in workshops to other species, or other situations. Here are some examples to think about. Thinking about these situations will help to improve our grasp of the principes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of quantitative genetics\n\n\n\n\nMost SNPs have no effect, or very small effects, on traits.\nSNPs that do affect traits, are generally responsible for less than 5% of the trait variation.\nEffect sizes are also small for other genetic variants, such as transposon insertions, duplications/deletions and so on.\nGenetic variants can affect one trait, or several.\nIn the short term, selection occurs on haplotypes, but over time recombination will separate linked variants.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.1 Question 1. Why do we observe that most genetic variants have small effects on traits?\nHint: There are two was to anwser this one. a) To think about what we would expect to happen over time to variants that do have large effects. Consider those with large negative (deleterious) effects first, then those that are large and advantagous. b) To consider The Neutral Theory of Moleclar Evolution and molecular biology. If you change one amino acid in one protein, how much would you expect this to affect fitness? What about one synonymous mutation?\n\n\n5.0.2 Question 2. Imagine we observe that a fungicde-resistant fungus is spread though a country, destroying crops.\nWe know that this fungicde-resistance is new, so we hypothesise that a new mutation has occured. We can culture this fungus in the laboratory and measure their fungicde-resistance. How could we use quantiative genetics and population genetics together to find out what is happening?"

This pdf will appear in your working directory.\n\n#open the pdf writer\npdf(\"GWAS-plot3.pdf\",width=60)\n#set up the plot layout\nlayout(matrix(c(1:3), 1, 3, byrow = TRUE),widths = c(5579133,4539804,2452883))\npar(bty=\"l\",cex=0.8,mar=c(2,2,2,0)+2)\n#loop through chromosomes\nfor (j in 1:3){\n      #plot the salt GWAS points (black dots)\n      temp = subset(salt, Chr == j)\n      plot(temp$BP, -log10(temp$Wald_P),main = \"\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\")\n      \n      #add the glucose/fructose GWAS points (red crosses)\n      temp2 = subset(gluc, Chr == j)\n      points(temp2$BP, -log10(temp2$Wald_P),main = \"gluc\",ylim=c(1,10),xlab=\"position\",ylab=\"-log10(P)\",col=2,pch=3)\n      \n      #add the significance threshold\n      abline(h=-log10(1e-5),col=2,lty=2)\n}\n#close the pdf writer\ndev.off()\n\nNow find the pdf called GWAS-plot3.pdf and take a look.\n\n3.6.1 Might mutations for two traits conflict?\nLook at that significant peak on chromosome 3, at position ~1,500,000. Remember, this will have a large effect size. See how there is also an important variant for glucose & fructose use on chromosome 3, near the same position.\nLet’s consider what might happen if alleles are linked and the environment is complex (which all environments are). In this case, we consider an environment which is salty, but has plenty of fructose. A coastal vineyard, for example.\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhaplotypes\n\n\n\nIn a physical sense a haplotype is a length of DNA from one chromosome. For diploid species such as yourself tht have a paternal and a maternal chromosome, this is easy to understand.\nBut for fission yeast is haploid (one copy of each chromosome), what does this mean? We can think of different haplotypes as different versions of the chromosome that exist within the population. Each will carry it’s own SNPs.\nThrough meiotic recombination, haplotypes will be mixed. But SNPs that are very close together on the chromosome will not become separated very often. So they will usually travel together.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Haplotype problems\nCondider these situations:\n\nWhat might happen if the all the helpful alleles are on the same haplotype?\nWhat might happen if the two helpful alleles are on different (opposing) haplotypes?\n\nThe figures below will help to explain.\n Figure 2. Beneficial alleles on one haplotype. Would there be any ‘conflict’ here?\n\n Figure 3. Beneficial alleles on two different haplotypes. What might happen here? What would the problem be?"

There is disagreement about whether this civilization domesticated goats (if they were goats) or if they merely caught and ate wild goats.\nLuckily, in this scenario, we can occasionally obtain small amounts of DNA from the bones of sheep (or goats) at Çatalhöyük and Aşıklı Höyük. The samples we consider are described below. Note that while this is a hypothetical example, studies of ancient civilizations do use DNA and population genomics.\nFor example, the study of Population genomics of the Viking world used population genomics extensively. Çatalhöyük is older, so in our scenario, we assume the quality and quantity of DNA is much lower."

But it is better to map reads within species, rather than between.\n\n2.2.1 The data\nYou can obtain small amounts of DNA from these ancient sheet/goat samples:\n\n10 samples from Çatalhöyük\n10 samples from Aşıklı Höyük\n\nThere are thousands of genomes of modern goats and available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) from the VarGoats project. This includes goat genomes from Pakistan, Spain & France, the Mediterranean, Northern Europe and most importantly, wild goats from Turkey and Iran.\nThere are also more than 100 ancient genomes from Eurasian domestic and wild sheep samples spanning the past 12,000 years from this article, and 100s of modern sheep genomes available at ENA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou do not need to read these articles, but they show us what population genomic data is available.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 The problem\nThe archaeologists want to know whether Çatalhöyük and Aşıklı Höyük regularly traded sheet and/or goats.\nAn experienced ancient DNA technician has extracted DNA for you from Çatalhöyük and Aşıklı Höyük. There isn’t much, but you can sequence it. You do, and it is disappointing - the sequence reads map to only ten tiny regions in 0.5% of the goat genome and 0.4% of the sheep genome. They don’t have the funds or the samples to obtain any more.\nThe challenge is to explain what this might mean if the SNPs show the samples are more like sheep, more like goats, or in between, and if they traded sheep and goats with each other, or merely caught wild sheep and goats."
