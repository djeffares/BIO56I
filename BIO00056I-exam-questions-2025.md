Question 3 (Dan, 20 marks)
Malaria causes about 600,000 deaths each year. Plasmodium falciparum is a single celled eukaryotic parasite that causes malaria. P. falciparum infections are restricted to humans and the parasite is transmitted from person to person by mosquitos. The life cycle involved sexual recombination, with the haploid male and female forms developing within the human host which form diploid zygotes in the mosquito. Malaraia infections are treated with drugs, but mutations occur in thsi parasite that result in drug resistance occur from time to time. 

More than 20,000 P. falciparum genomes have been sequenced. The parasites were collected from Africa, South America, South East Asia and Oceania (countries in the Pacific ocean). The majority were collected between the years 2000 and 2020. From these genomes, 3 million SNPs were identified, enabling many different population genetic analyses.

a)  Given your knowledge about population genomics, explain why collecting and sequencing the genomes of 20,000 P. falciparum strains is useful for malaria control and elimination? In your answer, describe some questions about P. falciparum biology that we could not answer from just one single P. falciparum genome, but could answer from the large population genomics data set we have now.

Model Answer: Population structure: are P. falciparum parasites divided into populations that are genetically different? (2). Genome scale genetic diversity: Are different populations more or less diverse? (2). Gene diversity studies, selection and cell biology: Which genes have higher or lower genetic diversity? (1). Can we identify genes that appear to be subject to balancing selection, strong purifying selection, or selective sweeps (2-3). Migration analyses: Where are parasites migrating to/from? (1) By what routes are drug resistance alleles migrating? (2)


b) Some of the P. falciparum genomes are from the progeny crosses of strains. What could we find out by sequencing many progeny (eg: about 300) of a cross between a drug resistant strain and a drug susceptible strain. In your answer, describe: 
i) What we could discover from such an experiment, and what value this would have?
ii) What analysis method(s) could we use to discover this information?
iii) In addition to genomes, what other information would we require about the 300 strains we sequenced?
iv) Assuming our parental strains are 'wild' strains collected from patients, and not laboratory-adapted strains, would it be wiser to choose the parental strains from the same location (eg: one village in Ghana), or from two geographically distant regions (eg: Ghana and Brazil)? Justify your answer based on aspects of population genetics.


c) Drug resistance appears to spread rapidly, within counrties and between continents. Which principles of population genetics will help us to distinguish resistance alleles within the population genomics data sets?
