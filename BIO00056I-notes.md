## My weeks

### week6: done

Directed study 9 (recording): Phylogenies & Molecular Clock
Directed study 10 (worksheet): Phylogenies & Molecular Clock
Workshop 5: Phylogenies & Molecular Clock

Monday announcement:

Week 6: BIO00056I Population Genetics \& Evolution

Hi Everyone,

Last week we learned about population structure and conservation genetics. This week we will learn about what we can do with phylogenetic trees and we will learn about the molecular clock, a concept that is central to constructing and interpreting phylogenetic trees.

This week you should:

Watch two videos on phylogenies and the molecular clock.
Attempt worksheet 10, where we apply phylogenetic thinking.
Attend workshop 5, where we examine influenza virus data and see some very strong evidence for the molecular clock.

The model answers from last week’s workshop are available under week 5/Learning materials. As usual, please use the discussion board if you have any questions, or ask in one of the sessions.

Best wishes,
Dan

### week7: ongoing checks

Week 7: BIO00056I Population Genetics & Evolution

Hi everyone,

Last week we learned about the information we can extract from phylogenetic trees. And saw how the molecular clock is certainly ticking at a regular rate for influenza viruses. This week we look at the field of population genomics, which is the collection and analysis of population genetic data on a genome-wide scale.


This week the learning materials are:

* A lecture on population genomics (Tuesday)
* Worksheet 11, which will help you to develop you understanding of population genomics: https://djeffares.github.io/BIO56I/worksheet11.html
* A workshop on population genomics (Friday): https://djeffares.github.io/BIO56I/workshop6.html

Tomorrow, I will provide the model answers from last week’s workshop and self study worksheet via these links:

https://djeffares.github.io/BIO56I/workshop5.html

https://djeffares.github.io/BIO56I/worksheet10.html

As usual, please use the discussion board if you have any questions, or ask in one of the sessions.

Best wishes,
Dan

  - Workshop 7: Comparative Genomics (work in progress)


------

Hello everyone,

My apologies for sending this message on a Tuesday (rather than Monday).

Last week we learned about population genomics, which is the collection and analysis of population genetic data on a genome-wide scale. We saw in the workshop how we can describe populations using various display methods.

This week we learn about comparative genomics, the comparative study of the genomes of different species. We can learn an enormous amount about evolution from comparative genomics, particularly about the longer time scales of evolution, over millions of even billions of years.

This week, the learning materials are:

1. Recordings on Comparative genomics
  Part 1: https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cc8b5614-79f5-4d23-a64f-b0be0106669a
  Part 2: https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=bccbfa56-156a-435d-b462-afc100d31866  

2. Worksheet 12, on comparative genomics
https://djeffares.github.io/BIO56I/worksheet12.html

3. Workshop 7: comparative genomics, where we will observe patterns of evolution over thousands, then millions of even billions of years.

https://djeffares.github.io/BIO56I/workshop7.html

Later today, I'll provide a final video on comparative genomics.

best wishes
Daniel Jeffares

### week 10

Workshop 9: Quantitative Genetics 2

## Exam questions 2025

## New pathogen Could the situation be more complex than we suppose? How would you ensure you have robust answers?

## Question 3. Could the situation be more complex than we suppose? How would you ensure you have robust answers?

Yes, it could be, as the natural world is complex (1 mark). Perhaps there is a new strain of one of the pathogens, the new pathogen it is a hybrid of *Leishmania* and *Endotrypanum* (2 marks)? Using two genes helps us to see if our results are robust (2 marks). Once we have the DNA from patients, sand flies and vectors. If we suspect hybridization, we should design PCR primers for ~10 more genes and see what this shows (3 marks). If there is a hybrid some patient samples might cluster with *Leishmania* and some with *Endotrypanum*.





## From Julia

* You can use this checklist when you are reviewing your material:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s6ALyqcy-dWFtaORpQsEZyL9dJnfVxrXsGo4nE332BU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3yor058g7zod



* Exam: The exam questions will be due by the end of the consolidation week (31 Oct).  There'll be a proper call nearer the time
* We are doing in person lectures every two weeks.  Please check the timetable for which material is in person, this will require some extra work converting video material into a lecture.
* Send an announcement on Mondays, make sure it gets emailed to students.
* Accessibility. We got a request to check the accessibility of our material, please see Adrian's email below and check all your material.
* make anything you have provided as a google doc/sheet/slide or pdf available as a docx, xlsx or pptx file on the VLE, because students will then be able to download alternative formats.
* check all your materials (see Adrian's email) for accessibility using the tools below and make appropriate changes.
* Workshop answers in red are not very accessible because of the low contrast.  If you are using word, can you please create a style called model answer (or use the template on the shared drive).  That way students can easily change the colour to something that suits them.  This isn't possible in google docs.
* If you have been providing any material as google docs/slides/sheets etc:  We have been keeping these on this shared google drive, please keep them there. If you want to keep providing links to google documents and update anything significantly, please keep the old version and rename the file to include the year (for any LoA students on an old VLE site) and make a copy for the new file. That way students will always have access to the correct documents, no matter what happens to any of us. Students have viewing access to the weekly folders on the drive but not the drive itself.



* Please make sure that there are enough exam style questions in the workshops.  Students have been struggling with some of the material, so it's important that we provide questions that are similar enough to the exam questions.
* Dan, as agreed your last workshop (week 8) is not in a computer room.  You can still use any figures etc that the students would have produced themselves, but please rework the workshop to use this material for more exam style questions.  It could include questions about the other two weeks.
* More on workshops. We still can't schedule the release of model answers. So please post these manually as soon as possible after a session (and remove them before the material gets released).
* The discussion board is anonymous, so we will continue using this.  The notifications are a bit erratic, so please check regularly.
* Video captions.  Just a reminder, these should be edited and available.  Please also add a transcript txt file to the VLE.  If you are rerecording anything: Gareth has a great guide on producing captions using whisper.  It works well but if you edit the video before producing the captions it does not handle cuts well, so please check.
